**Part I CMP Compliance Program**


**A.** **Introduction**


Crouse Medical Practice, (the “Practice”) is committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner.

Accordingly, the practice has developed and implemented a Compliance Program that applies to all affected

individuals including employees, chief executive and other senior administrators, managers, contractors, agents,

subcontractors, independent contractors and governing and corporate offices (collectively referred to as “staff”).

The practice’s Compliance Program is intended to prevent, detect, and correct violations of applicable law,
regulations, third party payer requirements, hospitals policies/procedures, the Code of Conduct and other

applicable standards.

The Compliance Program consists primarily of the key elements described in the Compliance Plan, Crouse Medical

Practice’s Code of Conduct and various policies and procedures designated to implement the Compliance Program.

The Handbook also contains a summary of the relevant health care fraud and abuse laws, including whistleblower
protection laws. As described in greater detail in the Handbook and the Non-Intimidation/Non-Retaliation Policy,


3


the practice has adopted a strict non-intimidation/non-retaliation policy to protect affected individuals for their

good faith reporting of compliance-related concerns or issues.

Staff who fail to comply with the elements of the Compliance Program as described in this handbook, may face
disciplinary action including, but not limited to, removal, reprimand, suspension without pay and/or termination

from employment or affiliation with the practice.

**B.** **Member Authorization**


The Practice’s Member and Executive Team (“Board”) authorized the creation of a Compliance Program. The
purpose of the program is to promote and support the highest standards of conduct - legally, ethically and morally,
on the part of the Practice and its personnel and vendors, regarding all laws and rules that regulate the Practice,
including, but not limited to, Medicare and Medicaid requirements and the applicable New York State and federal
fraud, waste and abuse laws. The Board authorized the Practice’s President to appoint a Compliance Officer “CO”
that is a member of the Risk Management Corporate Compliance staff, is designated as the individual who serves
as the Practice’s Compliance Officer, and works in cooperation with the Practice’s Compliance Committee.


The Board shall act in good faith in the oversight of the Practice’s compliance activities. The Board shall abide by its


        - Duty of care (to be familiar with the finances and activities, attend meetings and participate in decision

making, read material and minutes, encourage diversity).

        - Duty of loyalty (to avoid transactions were there is personal gain and closely examine other transactions

which may cause a conflict of interest).

        - Duty of obedience (to ensure that the Practice is abiding by applicable laws and regulations and that the

proper resources are dedicated to following the mission).

Any questions concerning the Practice’s Compliance Program should be directed to the CO, or their designee.


**Part II CMP Compliance Plan: Summary of Key Elements**

**A.** **Standards of Conduct**


_**It is our policy to provide services in compliance with all state and federal laws governing our operations, and**_

_**consistent with the highest standards of business and professional ethics.**_ _**ALL PRACTICE STAFF MUST ACT IN**_

_**ACCORDANCE WITH THESE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND THIS COMPLIANCE PLAN.**_


The Practice expects Staff and affected individuals to refrain from conduct which may violate applicable federal and

state fraud and abuse laws. These laws prohibit:


(1) direct, indirect or disguised payments in exchange for the referral of patients;
(2) the submission of false, fraudulent or misleading claims to any government entity or third-party payer,


including claims for services not rendered, claims which characterize the service differently than the

service actually rendered, claims for substandard patient care, or claims which do not otherwise comply

with applicable program or contractual requirements; and

(3) making false representations to any person or entity in order to gain or retain participation in a program


or to obtain payment for any service.


4


Conduct that does not comply with this Plan is not authorized by the Practice and is outside the scope of practice
employment or affiliation. The Compliance Officer, in cooperation with the Compliance Committee, is charged with
monitoring and implementing this Plan.

If, at any time, you become aware of an apparent violation of the Plan, you _**must**_ report it to your supervisor, the

Compliance Officer or a member of the Compliance Committee. Reports may also be made to the President and to
the Board. Reports may be made anonymously and/or confidentially. Confidential reports will be kept confidential

unless the matter is referred to law enforcement or such disclosure is otherwise required by law to be disclosed. No

adverse action will ever be taken against you solely for making a report in good faith or based on reasonable belief.

If you do not report a violation of the Plan or Practice policy of which you are aware, you may be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and/or affiliation with the Practice. Employees

must report concerns to their supervisor, who is required to report issues of actual or suspected non-compliance to

the Compliance Officer; however, if your supervisor is the subject of the conflict, or if you are uncomfortable talking

to your supervisor, or you do not receive a satisfactory response, employees may make a report to another
member of management/compliance, including directly to the Compliance Officer, or may utilize any of the

Practice’s other available reporting methods.


The laws governing our activities are complex. This Plan only deals with some of the important legal principles

under which we operate. Their mention is not intended to minimize the importance of other applicable laws,

professional standards or ethical principles, which may be covered in other Practice policies, programs and

literature. Consequently, if you are in doubt you should promptly communicate with your supervisor or with the

Compliance Officer before undertaking any course of action.


**B.** **Development & Implementation of Written Standards of Conduct, Policies & Procedures**


The Practice shall operate in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws, and standards pertaining to
the delivery of patient care and the billing for such care. To this end, the Practice has developed policies and
procedures to foster compliance with such laws and standards and to promote conduct by the Practice and
affected individuals that are ethical and uphold our mission and values.


The Compliance Officer, or their designee, with input from the Compliance Committee, shall oversee the
development and implementation of policies pertaining to the Compliance Program and/or the Code of Conduct.
Corporate Compliance Policies and the Compliance Handbook are reviewed at least annually and in accordance
with Practice procedures. The Practice shall update its standards, policies and procedures as necessary to remain
current with applicable law and regulations, the needs of the Practice and its Compliance Program and to reflect
current ethical and legal business practices.


Employees and affected individuals who have questions, suggestions and/or concerns about the Compliance

Program, current Practice standards, policies, procedures, business, patient care or other practices should notify

their supervisor or the CO, or may call the Compliance Hotline (315-479-5070 ext. 66107), or submit a Compliance

Reporting Form which can be found on the Practice’s website.

**C.** **Delegation of Authority to the Compliance Officer & Committee**


Crouse Medical Practice has designated a Compliance Officer (“CO”), who reports directly to the Practice’s

President and, as appropriate, the Board, and the Compliance Committee. The CO may delegate as they deem

appropriate, an individual, such as the HIPAA Security Officer, to assist in the day to day operation and duties of the


5


CO. The CO’s compliance authority and obligations are more fully explained in the Practices Compliance Officer and

Oversight policy.

CMP has formed the Compliance Committee to function as the compliance committee. The CO is an active member

of the Committee, as well as those individuals listed in the Committee Charter. The Committee meets no less than

quarterly and is comprised of those individuals whose input is necessary for the proper oversight and

implementation of the Practice’s Compliance Program. The Committee shall report directly and be accountable to

the Executive Director and governing body.


**D.** **Provision of Compliance Education and Training**


Crouse Medical Practice conducts compliance training and education to help ensure that each affected individual is


fully capable of executing their duties in conformity with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and other standards. It

is an expectation of performance that employees and affected individuals meet their compliance education and

training requirements. Failure to undergo compliance education and training may result in discipline, up to and

including termination.


Crouse Medical Practice has developed a Compliance Training Plan that includes:


    - An outline of the subjects and topics for the training education;

    - The timing and frequency of the training;

    - Which affected individuals are required to attend;

    - How attendance will be tracked;

    - How the effectiveness of the training will be periodically evaluated.


In general, employees shall undergo appropriate levels of compliance training during New Employee Orientation

(NEO). Certain employees may also receive additional targeted compliance training depending upon the person’s

job-related obligations and responsibilities. Contractors and vendors that are affected by the Practices risk areas

shall receive annual compliance education and training. They will also be provided access to the Practices

compliance policies and procedures, the Code of Conduct and contact information for the Compliance Program via

the website (Crousemed.com)


**E.  Reporting Concerns and Complaints through Open Communication & Compliance Hotline**


All affected individuals have a responsibility to immediately report any activity involving or concerning the Practice
that appears to violation the Compliance Program, the Code of Conduct or any CMP policy/procedure, as well as

applicable laws, rules or regulations. Therefore, the practice has established a means for concerns or complaints to

be reported in a safe and private manner. There is absolutely no retaliation permitted for the good faith reporting of

actual or suspected compliance problems. Failure to report may, by itself, be a violation of the Practices Compliance

Program, which may subject the person to discipline, up to and including termination or employment or affiliation

with the practice.


The Practice has published on their website (crousemed.com) the anonymous hotline reporting phone number and
contact information for the Compliance Officer to report compliance- related concerns or issues and/or to ask

questions or make suggestions about the Compliance Program.


**F.** **Requiring Employee Participation in the Compliance Program and Discipline**


6


It is the responsibility of all affected individuals to abide by applicable laws, regulations, support the Practices

compliance efforts, and to participate in the Corporate Compliance Program. Accordingly, each affected individual

must report their good faith belief of any suspected or actual violation or applicable local, state, or federal law or

practice policies and procedures, including, without limitation, the practices Compliance Program and Code of

Conduct. There are many activities that could be considered a violation. Potential violations include fraudulent

billing suspicion, incorrect patterned claim activity, misrepresentation, stealing, etc. In support of this principle, the

practice has also adopted a strict non-retaliation policy prohibiting any retaliation against anyone who in good faith

reports a suspected or actual violation. The practice shall take reasonable and appropriate efforts to maximize a

reporting individual’s confidentiality and will honor all requests for confidentiality to the limit allowed by law.


The practice shall enforce sanctions and discipline resulting from a violation of this Program, relevant laws and

regulations and Practice policies and procedures in a fair and consistent manner. Enforcement of sanctions for

violations shall be documented by the Compliance Officer.

**G.  Conducting Audits and Routine Identification of Compliance Risk Areas**


Crouse Medical Practice has established and implemented an effective system for routine monitoring and
identification of compliance risks. This includes internal monitoring/audits and as appropriate, external audits, to

evaluate the practices compliance program with the requirements of Medicare and Medicaid and the overall

effectiveness of the compliance program. The practice shall assess its risk for noncompliance and shall take steps

necessary to reduce any identified compliance issues. The CO or their designee, in conjunction with the Compliance

Committee and the necessary practice departments, shall conduct ongoing and periodic reviews of the compliance

program and its operations and systems.

Practice Resources, LLC (“PRL”) will provide the Practice with a written report of its audit findings, which provides

data for the Practice to evaluate the coder’s accuracy and competence for the audit period. The Compliance Officer

is responsible for investigating incidents discovered by the audits, systemic errors, or reports of suspected

noncompliance. The results of the audit process may be communicated to and discussed with legal counsel to

determine whether any corrective action is required.

**H** . **Responding to and Investigating Potential Compliance Problems**


Crouse Medical Practice takes potential compliance issues seriously and investigates compliance issues promptly,

regardless of the sources of the complaint or concern. The practice has established and implemented procedures for

responding to compliance issues including complaints, violations of applicable laws, regulations, practice policies,

procedures and standards (including the Code of Conduct and Compliance Program), state and federal laws, rules

and regulations, and requirements of Medicare and Medicaid.

The purpose of an investigation is to identify those situations in which applicable laws and regulations may not have
been followed. The CO, or their designee, has a primary responsibility for conducting and/or over seeing

investigations. When an investigation determines that a violation has occurred, corrective actions are initiated to

ensure compliance. These can include:


    - Instituting disciplinary action;

    - Implementing corrective actions to prevent the violation from reoccurring;

    - Notifying the appropriate government agency;


7


    - Repayment of government funds within the 60 day timeframe for overpayments.

**I.** **Non-Intimidation/ Non-Retaliation for Good Faith Reporting of Compliance-Related Concerns**

The practice is committed to maintaining a workplace where affected individuals are free to raise good faith

concerns regarding CMP’s business practices and the care of it patients. It is the responsibility of all individuals to

abide by applicable laws and regulations and support the practices compliance efforts, including reporting their

good faith belief of any violation of applicable local, state or federal law or practice policies and procedures,

including, without limitation, the practice’s Compliance Program and Code of Conduct. The practice is committed to

fostering a workplace that is conductive to open discussions of its business and clinical practices. To promote an

open culture, the practice has adopted a strict non-intimidation, non-retaliation policy.

**J.** **Deficit Reduction Act of 2005**


The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires any entity that receives at least $5 million per year in Medicaid payments
to make certain information available to it employees, contractors and agents. This information includes:


    - The Federal and New York State False Claims Acts;

    - The rights of employees to be protected as whistleblowers; and

    - The entity’s policies and procedures for detecting and preventing fraud, waste and abuse.

The Practice, in accordance with applicable local, state or federal law, and the Practice’s Policies and
Procedures, including, without limitation, the Practice’s Compliance Program and Code of Conduct, fully
complies with all applicable whistleblower protections.


K. **NYS Mandatory Compliance Program Requirements and Certification (SSL)**


Per NYS Social Services Law (SSL) §363-d and 18 NYCRR Part 521, A compliance program is required of all providers

where Medicaid is a “substantial portion of business operations.”


18 NYCRR §521.2(b) defines “substantial portion of business operations” as

expected to claim or order at least five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in any consecutive twelve-month
period from the medical assistance program;
(2) when a person, provider or affiliate receives or has received, or should be reasonably expected to receive at

least five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in any consecutive twelve-month period directly or indirectly
from the medical assistance program; or
(3) when a person, provider or affiliate who submits or has submitted claims for care, services, or supplies to the

medical assistance program on behalf of another person or persons in the aggregate of at least five hundred

the Practice is attesting that is satisfactorily meeting the requirements of SSL §363-d, which includes the federal DRA
certification. Annual certification shall occur by the anniversary date of the provider’s enrollment in Medicaid, which

can be found on their initial Medicaid enrollment welcome letter.

All affected individuals should strive to protect and promote patient’s rights, quality of care, practice-wide integrity,

with our Mission, Vision and Value statements and our Compliance Policies and Procedures.


It is important for all affected individuals to understand personal obligations under this Code of Conduct. The Code

procedure. Instead, the Code contains principles that are intended to guide individuals in making ethical decisions in

carrying out duties for or on behalf of Crouse Medical Practice.

All affected individuals share in the responsibility to uphold the principles of caring, honesty, and integrity that are

fundamental to this Code of Conduct. _If at any time, you have questions, comments or suggestions regarding the_

9


Practice Employee should be committed to this expectation, even if such Employee does not provide direct

patient care.


**Reporting Concerns** . Affected individuals should report any incident of patient care or safety that does not

appear to meet Crouse Medical Practice’s standards of care. Reports can be made to a supervisor, the
Compliance Officer (315) 470-2368, and/or the Compliance Hotline (315) 479-5070, ext. 66107, or via the

response from CMP or believes a patient’s immediate health and safety is in jeopardy, they may contact the New

York State Department of Health (“DOH”) at 1-800-804-5447. Patient concerns related to quality of care or other

such standards should be reported to the department’s Practice Administrator.


**Direct Care Providers.** Affected individuals who are directly involved in patient care must have the proper

credentials, skills, expertise and competency to care for such patients. Each individual should promptly and

efficiently fulfill any personal responsibility they may have concerning the delivery of patient care and compliance

with applicable standards of care. Care must be medically necessary, appropriate to the situation, safe and in

conformity with applicable standards of care.


**Patient Rights.** Affected individuals should become familiar with patient rights and, as appropriate, are

encouraged to help patients and their families understand their rights as well. Examples of patient rights include,

but are certainly not limited to, informed consent to treatment, participation in decision-making, non
discrimination and confidentiality.


**Patient Care Standards/Policies.** Crouse Medical Practice maintains policies and procedures concerning patient

care and rights. All employees are encouraged to refer to the policies and procedures that relate to their Crouse

Medical Practice work-related obligations, which are available from their department supervisor and can be

found on the Data Sharefile.

Crouse Medical Practice works diligently to foster a safe, professional, cooperative and creative workplace for all

affected individuals, and to comply with all health and safety laws and regulations governing the workplace. All

affected individuals will strive to work collaboratively with colleagues and communicate respectfully to and about

others, and in a positive manner.


Affected individuals are expected to become familiar with and understand Crouse Medical Practice’s policies and

procedures developed to promote the protection of the workplace and to observe all posted notices, warnings

and regulations.

Employees shall comply with Crouse Medical Practice’s policy of a smoke and drug/alcohol free workplace.

Employees must report to work free from the influences of illegal drugs and alcohol.

Crouse Medical Practice is committed to providing a work environment that is free from harassment, violence,

threatening or intimidation conduct. All individuals must conduct themselves in an appropriate and professional

manner. Engaging in verbal, physical, or other conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive

workplace will not be tolerated.

**3.** **Exclusion Screening**


10


Crouse Medical Practice does not hire, employ or enter into any business arrangement with any entity or person
who is excluded from participating in any government health care benefits program. The Practice conducts/

contracts out exclusion (sanction) screening of all applicants and employees, candidates for, and current

members of, the medical staff, independent contractors, and vendors for exclusion from government health care
programs. Exclusion Screenings shall be conducted prior to the start of the business/employment relationship

and at least 30 days thereafter

**4.** **Non-Discrimination**


Crouse Medical Practice believes that the fair treatment of affected individuals, patients and others is vital to the

fulfillment of its Mission, Vision, and Values.


Individuals shall treat all persons with respect and shall not discriminate or harass in any manner any person on
the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and/or gender identity expression, marital or

parental status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, veteran or military status, age, disability,

reproductive health decision making, or source of payment with respect to patients.


Crouse Medical Practice recruits, hires, trains, promotes, assigns, transfers, lays off/recalls and terminates all

members of its workforce based on the individual’s ability, achievement, experience, and conduct without regard
to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and/or gender identity expression, marital or parental

status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, veteran or military status, age, disability, reproductive health
decision making, or any other classification protected by law. All allegations of discrimination and/or harassment

shall be promptly investigated in accordance with human resources, corporate compliance or other applicable

policies and procedures.


**5.** **Compliance with Federal, State, and Local Laws and Regulations**


Crouse Medical Practice strives to ensure that all activity by or on its behalf complies with applicable laws and

regulations. To foster this compliance, all affected individuals should familiarize themselves with the laws and

regulations relating to the employee’s position. Employees who have management or supervisory positions

should also seek out professional development opportunities that will help them carryout responsibilities.


Affected individuals who are licensed professionals should become familiar with the legal requirements

associated with their licenses and should have an understanding of what actions constitute professional

misconduct and should avoid such actions. The New York State Education Department provides detailed

information on professional licensure requirements as well as information on professional misconduct:
[https://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/](https://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/)


The Compliance Department will develop educational programs to help affected individuals understand such

applicable laws and regulations. If at any time, an employee has questions regarding a law, regulation or related

Crouse Medical Practice Policy, the Compliance Officer can serve as a resource.


**6.** **Health Care Fraud and Abuse Prevention**


One of the primary goals of Crouse Medical Practice’s Compliance Program is to prevent and detect fraud, waste,

and abuse. Health care decision-making must be based upon the patient’s medical needs, and must not be based

upon financial benefits to Crouse Medical Practice, affected individuals (including medical staff), or that of any

other entity or individual. Crouse Medical Practice is committed to this principle.


11


Crouse Medical Practice and its affected individuals may not give, receive, offer or ask for anything of value in

exchange for referring patients, products, or services (“Anti-Kickback”). This includes accepting anything of value

for purchasing, leasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending a particular product or service.


Crouse Medical Practice shall ensure that its relationships with physicians satisfy the rules concerning the

prohibition against physician self-referral (both the Federal Stark Law and applicable state law).


CMP employees and affected individuals must not submit false or fraudulent or misleading claims to any payer,

including Medicare, Medicaid, or other government or commercial third party payers. Such prohibited claims

include claims for services not rendered, claims which characterize the service differently than the service

actually rendered, or claims which do not comply with payer requirements. Furthermore, no one may make false

representations to any person or entity for purposes of participation in a health care benefits program or to get a
claim paid. CMP shall report, repay, and address the system/process issues in regards to overpayments submitted

to these programs. Federal Law requires all identified overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid to be reported

and returned within 60 days of identification.


All affected individuals must report suspected or actual fraud and/or abuse activities by calling the Compliance
Officer at (315) 470-2368, or by submitting the Compliance Reporting Form on the Crouse Medical Practice
website. Reports can also be made anonymously using the Compliance Hotline (315) 479-5070, ext. 66107. See
the “Responsibility for Reporting” Section of this Code of Conduct for more details. Crouse Medical Practice does
not retaliate against anyone who reports in good faith suspected or actual fraud and abuse or other concerns.


**7.** **Coding and Reimbursement**


Crouse Medical Practice promotes full compliance with all relevant billing and claims reimbursement

requirements.


All persons who are involved in any aspect of CMP’s coding, billing and claims submission processes must be

appropriately trained, credentialed, and prepared for their responsibilities, including without limitation

appropriate training with respect to the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. All CMP staff are

expected to monitor compliance with applicable billing rules, to the extent they are able, and must report any

false, inaccurate or questionable claims to a supervisor or to the Compliance Officer immediately.


CMP only bills for services actually rendered as reflected in the medical documentation. All clinical staff are

required to document health care services in an accurate, organized, legible and timely manner and in

accordance with applicable billing rules and CMP policies.


**8.** **Accurate and Truthful Documentation**


Affected individuals who are responsible for documenting in patient records, financial records, or other Crouse

Medical Practice business records must perform their duties accurately, truthfully, completely and in a timely

manner. All patient records, financial and accounting reports, research reports, expense accounts, time sheets

and any other documentation must accurately and clearly represent the relevant facts and the true nature of a

transaction. No one may alter or falsify information on any CMP record or document. Anyone who suspects
inaccurate documentation and/or record keeping must notify their supervisor and/or the Compliance Officer, or

Compliance Hotline.


All records, both medical and business, shall be retained and disposed of in accordance with applicable law and

CMP’s specific record retention policies.


**9.** **Record Retention and Destruction**


12


All affected individuals must protect the integrity of CMP’s documents and records to ensure that records are

maintained in accordance with regulatory and legal requirements, and for the required length of time. All

records, both medical and business, shall be retained and disposed of in accordance with applicable law and

CMP’s specific record retention policies. Records and documents, which include both written and computer
based information, such as e-mail or computer files on disk or tape, shall be retained and destroyed in

accordance with CMP policy and procedures.


**10.** **Confidentiality**


Crouse Medical Practice has in its possession a broad variety of confidential, sensitive and proprietary

information, which if inappropriately released, could be harmful to individuals, our business partners and to

Crouse Medical Practice itself. Therefore, Employees should always safeguard confidential information

concerning patients, employees, and business matters in accordance with Crouse Medical Practice’s policies and

procedures and relevant state and federal law. Each affected individual must always respect and maintain the

privacy of confidential information, even after they are no longer affiliated with Crouse Medical Practice.


Affected Individuals should become familiar with their department’s specific policies and procedures in addition

to organization-wide policies, such as the Notice of Privacy Practices as required by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).


Employees must also treat as confidential, salary, benefits, and other personal information pertaining to

Employees. Personnel files, payroll information, disciplinary matters and similar information will be maintained

in a confidential manner.


In addition to safeguarding patient and personnel information, affected individuals must also protect Crouse

Medical Practice’s proprietary information. This means that no one should disclose CMP’s confidential business

information, such as contractual arrangements, strategic plans, future marketing efforts, and financial

information.


Generally, an affected individual should only access and use the information necessary to perform their work
related responsibilities and should only disclose information as authorized to others having an official need to

know. If questions arise regarding an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information or the

appropriateness of releasing information, individuals should seek guidance from their supervisor, manager, or

director. Supervisors in turn should seek guidance from an appropriate Crouse Medical Practice administrator or

the Compliance Officer.


Crouse Medical Practice will protect the confidentiality of patient information. Protected Health Information, or

PHI, includes information such as: names, addresses, medical diagnoses, social security numbers, etc.


HIPAA also requires adherence to the minimum necessary standard for use and disclosure of patient information.

Below are some examples of inappropriate disclosure:


    - Access another employees medical records unless it is for treatment, payment, or operations

    - Discussing patient information in public areas (e.g. elevator, cafeteria) where it can be overheard by

others not involved in their care

    - Sharing information about a patient which your family members or friends

    - Reviewing your own medical records without following the proper procedure

**11.** **Conflict of Interest**


13


A conflict of interest may occur if an employee’s outside activities or personal financial interests influence or

appear to influence the employee’s ability to make objective decisions in the course of the employee carrying

out their Crouse Medical Practice responsibilities and obligations. Employees should always avoid such conflicts

of interest.


An employee should never use their position to profit personally or to assist others in profiting at the expense of

Crouse Medical Practice.


Crouse Medical Practice requires certain employees to disclose financial interests that they or their immediate

family member may have that would interfere or affect their responsibilities for or on behalf of Crouse Medical

Practice. Refer to Crouse Medical Practice’s Conflict of Interest Policy for more details concerning conflicts.

**12.** **Provider/Hospital Business Relationships and Referrals**


Any business relationship or arrangement between CMP and a physician, physician entity or other healthcare

provider must be structured to ensure compliance with all legal requirements, including, but not limited to, the

fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and to avoid jeopardizing CMP’s tax-exempt status. Such relationships

and arrangements must be documented in writing, signed by the parties and subject to review and approval by

CMP’s outside counsel.


CMP does not pay for patient referrals. CMP’s acceptance of patient referrals is based on the medical needs of

the patient and its ability to provide needed services. All CMP Directors, officers and employees are prohibited

from paying or offering to pay, directly or indirectly, for referral of patients. In addition, CMP will not accept

payments for the referrals it makes to a provider, nor take into account the volume or value of referrals that the

provider has or may make to CMP. No CMP Director, officer or employee shall accept or solicit any payment or

item of value, directly or indirectly, for referrals of patients to CMP.


**13.** **Protection of Crouse Medical Practice Assets**


Employees must strive to preserve Crouse Medical Practice’s assets, including equipment, materials, supplies,

time and information, and to protect assets from loss, damage, theft, misuse, and waste.


Employees must not remove Crouse Medical Practice’s equipment, materials and supplies from the premises for

personal use and must only use such assets as authorized under CMP policy.


Employees whose responsibilities include the management of departmental funds shall maintain internal

controls and record keeping and shall exercise appropriate oversight. Any use of Crouse Medical Practice’s

resources for personal financial gain unrelated to CMP business is not permitted.


Employee’s use of travel expenses must be consistent with the Employee’s job responsibility and Crouse Medical

Practice’s needs and resources. Employees are expected to exercise reasonable judgment in incurring travel

expenses and shall provide sufficient documentation for purposes of reimbursement.


As mentioned, time is also an asset. Employees shall report time and attendance accurately and shall use their

work time productively.


**14.** **Gifts and Gratuities**


Gifts that influence decision-making by or on behalf of Crouse Medical Practice are not permitted. Affected

individuals are prohibited from _soliciting_ tips, personal gratuities or any gifts from patients or their family

members and from accepting any monetary tips or gratuities. Individuals may accept (if offered), occasional gifts


14


of appreciation of no more than a nominal value from patients/families such as flowers, food or candy.

Monetary gifts of any value may not be accepted. If a patient or another individual wishes to present a

monetary gift, they should be referred to the appropriate Director or Hospital Foundation.


Employees may not accept or solicit from CMP’s business associates or vendors, individually or on behalf of

Crouse Medical Practice, gifts, favors, services, entertainment or other things of value to the extent that

decision-making or actions affecting CMP might be influenced. Similarly, the offer or giving of money, services

or other things of value with the expectation of influencing the judgment or decision-making process of any

purchaser, supplier, customer, government official or other person is absolutely prohibited. Individuals must
report any such conduct to their supervisor and/or the Compliance Officer.


**15.** **Tax Exempt Status**


Crouse Medical Practice is a tax exempt organization and has certain legal and ethical responsibilities.

Importantly, CMP is obligated to engage in activities that support its charitable purposes and to ensure that its

resources are used in a manner that furthers the public good rather than the private or personal interests of any

individual.  As a result, Crouse Medical Practice and its employees will only enter into compensation

arrangements that reflect fair market value for the service or item. In addition, Crouse Medical Practice will

accurately report tax payments and will file all tax information and returns in a lawful manner.

**16.** **Political/ Lobbying Activity**


Participation by Crouse Medical Practice in a political campaign or lobbying could jeopardize CMP’s tax-exempt

status. Therefore, employees may not use CMP’s funds, time, equipment or other assets to campaign for or

against any political candidate, or to engage in a lobbying activity. This includes contributing t-shirts, hats or any

other tangible item that includes the CMP logo.


Employees may participate in or contribute to, a political/lobbying activity of their choosing as a private citizen,

but not as a Crouse Medical Practice representative.


Crouse Medical Practice, where its experience may be helpful, may publically offer recommendations

concerning legislation or regulations being considered. In addition, Crouse Medical Practice may analyze and

take public positions on issues that have a relationship to the operations of the organization when our

experience contributes to the understanding of such issues.


Crouse Medical Practice has many contacts and dealings with governmental agencies and officials. CMP and its

employees shall conduct all such contacts and transactions in an honest and ethical manner. No one shall

attempt to influence the decision-making process of government agencies or officials by an improper offer of

any benefit. Employees should immediately report any suspected or actual improper requests or demands by a

government agency or official to the Compliance Officer.


**17.** **Fair Competition**


Crouse Medical Practice strives to ensure that all activity by or on its behalf complies with laws governing fair

competition (these laws are also known as “antitrust laws”). These laws prohibit certain activity that could give

an organization an unfair business advantage over a competitor. Examples of prohibited unfair competition

activities include: agreements to fix prices, bid rigging, collusion with competitors, boycotts, certain exclusive

dealing and price discrimination agreements, unfair trade practices, including bribery, misappropriation of trade

secrets, deception, intimidation and similar unfair practices. Employees must not engage in prohibited unfair


15


competition activities and must seek advice from the Compliance Officer when confronted with business

decisions which might violate these laws.


**18.** **Marketing**


Crouse Medical Practice may use marketing and advertising activities to educate the public, provide information

to the community and increase awareness of CMP’s services. CMP will present only truthful, fully informative

and non-deceptive information in these materials and announcements.

**19.** **Social Media**


Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of patient, employee and confidential business information is

fundamental to our mission as a leading healthcare provider. Posting any patient or proprietary information on
social media/networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or YouTube is prohibited. Authorized
personnel at Crouse Medical Practice (i.e. Communications and Human Resources) may use social media in the

course of their duties for approved, business-related purposes. Employees should refer to CMP’s Social Media

policy for more information.

**20.** **Prescription Drugs and Controlled Substances**


Crouse Medical Practice is committed to the safe and legal handling of all drugs and controlled substances.

Employees having responsibility for, or access to, prescription drugs, controlled substances, over-the-counter

drugs, or any street-valued medical supply (hypodermic needles for example) shall maintain the highest possible

professional and ethical standards with regards to such drugs and supplies. Employees should become familiar

with the laws, internal policies, and patient care standards that govern their work with these substances and

supplies. Drugs must only be provided upon an order of a licensed provider who is authorized by New York

State to write prescriptions. Employees shall take care to keep drugs secured at all times and not available to

individuals who do not have a prescription. Employees must follow CMP policy and procedures for handling

outdated or unused drugs. Employees must immediately report any known or suspected inappropriate
distribution or diversion of drugs or supplies, or theft/loss of prescriptions, to their supervisor or the Compliance

Officer.


The New York State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement provides many references for providers concerning drug

diversion and other controlled substances issues on its website:

**21.** **Environmental Health and Safety**


Crouse Medical Practice is committed to providing a workplace that is safe, healthy, smoke-free and in

compliance with all applicable rules and regulation. CMP shall manage and operate its business in a manner that

respects our environment and conserves natural resources. Employees shall comply with CMP’s safety and

health policies to help ensure that patients, visitors, the workforce and others are protected from unnecessary

risks and unsafe conditions.


For example, Employees shall dispose of all waste in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and shall

strive to utilize resources appropriately and efficiently, including recycling where possible. Employees shall

immediately report suspected violations of an environmental or occupational health and safety law and shall


16


work cooperatively with the appropriate authorities to remedy any environmental contamination that may

occur in the workplace. If a workplace injury occurs or a potential danger for injury is discovered, employees

must immediately contact their supervisor so corrective action can be taken to resolve the issue in a timely

manner.


**22.** **Scientific and Clinical Research**


CMP is firmly committed to adhering to the basic ethical principles underlying the acceptable conduct of

research involving human subjects, as set forth in The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the

Protection of Human Subjects of Research. These three principles, respect for persons, beneficence, and justice

are particularly relevant to the protection of human subjects in biomedical and behavioral research, and are the

accepted requirements for the ethical conduct of such research.


     - **Respect for persons** involves recognition of the personal dignity and autonomy (self-rule) of

individuals, and special protection of those persons with diminished autonomy.

     - **Beneficence** entails an obligation to protect persons from harm by maximizing anticipated results and

minimizing possible risks of harm.

     - **Justice** requires that the benefits and burdens of research be distributed fairly.

Employees who are involved in proposing and/or conducting research activities will ensure that their work is

conducted with the highest ethical standards in accordance with federal, New York state and local laws and

regulations, and applicable Crouse Health policy and procedures, including those from the Hospital’s

Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). Employees must always document accurately, truthfully and completely and
must never make up and/or falsify research data or results. Employees who have concerns or questions

regarding a research activity should contact their supervisor, the Corporate Compliance Officer or the Hospital’s

IRB Administrator at 315-470-5917.


**23.** **Government Investigations, Accreditations and Surveys**


Crouse Medical Practice and affected individuals shall cooperate fully and promptly with appropriate government

investigations into potential violations of the law and to the efforts of accreditation, enforcement and surveying
agencies. Governmental and/or agency inquiries or requests should be promptly referred to the Corporate

Compliance Officer or President.

Crouse Medical Practice promptly and thoroughly investigates reports of suspected illegal activities or violations

of the Compliance Program or this Code of Conduct. Employees must cooperate with such investigations and may

not take actions to prevent, hinder or delay a full investigation. For example, individuals must never alter or

destroy records or documents requested in the course of an investigation, nor shall they make a false or

misleading statement on such documents or to an investigator. Also, individuals must never pressure any person

to provide false information to, or to hide information from, an investigator.


**24.** **Responsibility for Reporting**


Corporate Compliance is everyone’s responsibility. Therefore, all affected individuals are required to report their

good faith or reasonable belief of any suspected or actual violation of the Code of Conduct, the Corporate

Compliance Program, CMP policies, or applicable law. Sometimes it is unclear whether a particular activity or

situation may be a violation of the Code or the Compliance Program. When this happens, Employees should


17


contact their supervisors or the Compliance Officer. If at any point it is a conflict to report a concern to the

supervisor (example: the supervisor is involved in the alleged misconduct), then the employee is required to
report the concern to a higher level of management and/or the Compliance Officer/Compliance Hotline.


Reports of suspected or actual violations can be made in a number of ways as described below:


   - Orally or in writing to the Employee’s director/supervisor;

   - By calling the Compliance Officer at 315-470-2368;

   - By calling the Anonymous Compliance Hotline at 315-479-5070, ext. 66107;

   - By mailing a written concern or complaint to the Compliance Officer at 739 Irving Avenue, Suite 340A,


Syracuse, NY 13210; and/or

   - By completing the Compliance Reporting Form on the CMP website:


[https://crousemed.com/compliance/report/](https://crousemed.com/compliance/report/)

Crouse Medical Practice will maintain the confidentiality of the reporter unless the matter is subject to a

disciplinary proceeding, referred to, or under investigation by the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, the Office of

Medicaid Inspector General or other law enforcement, or disclosure is required during a legal proceeding.

Anonymous reporting is available. However, CMP will be unable to provide feedback if anonymous reports are

made. Affected individuals who fail to report suspected or actual violations are themselves violating this Code,

our Corporate Compliance Program, and possibly the False Claims Act, and may be subject to discipline, which

could result in termination from employment or affiliation CMP.


**25.** **Non-Intimidation/Non-Retaliation**


Crouse Medical Practice is committed to fostering a workplace that is conducive to open discussion by affected

individuals of its business and clinical practices. To promote an open culture, CMP has adopted a strict nonintimidation/non-retaliation policy to protect affected individuals. Accordingly, there will be no retaliation in the

terms and conditions of employment or affiliation as a result of an individual’s good faith reporting of a violation

or suspected violation. Any manager, supervisor or other individual who commits or condones any form of

retaliation will be subject to discipline up to, and possibly including, termination of employment or affiliation with

CMP. For more information regarding applicable non-retaliation and whistleblower protection laws, please refer

[to the Reporting Compliance Issues and Non-Retaliation Policy](https://hospitaldocuments/Intranet/Components/PnP/DocTree_ViewFile.aspx?ModuleID=1472&ID=DC875543-13CC-4619-B022-CF584F4C7830) Corporate Compliance Policy.

**26.** **Enforcement of the Code of Conduct**


Affected individuals must understand that they will be subject to discipline for violations of the Code of Conduct,

up to and including termination of employment or affiliation with Crouse Medical Practice. The specific

disciplinary action depends upon the nature and severity of the violation. Crouse Medical Practice imposes

sanctions in a consistent manner in accordance with applicable Human Resources policies and procedures.


Examples of violations of the Code which could result in disciplinary action include:


   - Participating in activities that violate the Code;

   - Encouraging others to violate the Code;

   - Failing to report suspected violations of the Code; and

   - For employees who are supervisors or managers, failing to detect violations of the Code, if such violation


should have been discovered in the reasonable course of the employee’s job responsibilities.

of false claims or fraud against the government may bring a lawsuit in his or her own name and in the name of

the government.


**II.** **Federal and New York State Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws**


Both the federal and New York state governments fund health care programs that provide medical and mental
health care benefits to qualified patients. Examples of such government health care programs include, but are
not limited to, Medicare and Medicaid. To avoid waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid and other


19


programs, there are Federal and State laws designed to deter fraud and abuse, some of which are described

below.


**a.** **Federal False Claims Act, 31 USC §§ 3729 -3733**


This law applies to any person (or entity) who:


i. Knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to the United States Government, a false or

fraudulent claim for payment or approval;


ii. Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false

or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government;


iii. Conspires to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid;


iv. Has possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the Government

and, intending to defraud the Government or willfully to conceal the property, delivers, or causes to

PFCRA provides for administrative remedies against any person who knowingly makes a claim or statement
that the person knows or has reason to know is false, fictitious or fraudulent. The presence of a false claim
is not required: a false statement is enough to trigger remedies under PFCRA.

**c.** **New York State False Claims Act, New York State Finance Law, Article 13**


The New York State false claims act is very similar to the Federal False Claims Act. It prohibits the filing of a
false claim which means that a person:

i. Knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to any employee, office or agent of the state or a

local government, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;

ii. Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or

fraudulent claim paid or approved by the state or a local government;

or paid;


20


iv. Has possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the State or a

the property or money, delivers, or causes to be delivered, less property or money than the
amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt;

the state or a local government and, intending to defraud the state or a local government, makes
or delivers the receipt without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true;
vi. Knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation or debt, public property from an officer or

employee of the state or a local government knowing that the officer or employee lawfully may not
sell or pledge the property; or vii. Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false
record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or
property to the state or a local government.
viii.  A person who does any of the above acts will be liable for a civil penalty of between $6,000.00 and

$12,000.00 plus three times the amount of damages sustained by the state or local government.
The amount of damages may be reduced if the violator self discloses the violation.


**d.** **New York State Finance Law § 191**

Any current or former employee, contractor, or agent of any private or public employer who is discharged,
demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and

relief necessary to make the employee, contractor or agent whole. Such relief shall include but not be limited

to:

ii. hiring, contracting or reinstatement to the position such person would have had but for the discrimination

or to an equivalent position;

iv. payment of two times back pay, plus interest; and


v. compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs

and reasonable attorneys' fees.


For purposes of this section, a “lawful act” shall include, but not be limited to, obtaining or transmitting to the
state, a local government, a qui tam plaintiff, or private counsel solely employed to investigate, potentially file,
or file a cause of action under this article, documents, data, correspondence, electronic mail, or any other
information, even though such act may violate a contract, employment term, or duty owed to the employer or
contractor, so long as the possession and transmission of such documents are for the sole purpose of furthering
efforts to stop one or more violations of this article. Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to prevent
any law enforcement authority from bringing a civil or criminal action against any person for violating any
provision of law. An employee, contractor or agent described above in subdivision one of this section may bring
an action in the appropriate supreme court for the relief provided in this section.


**e.** **Qui Tam Lawsuits**


The Federal False Claims Act and the New York State False Claims Act also provide for _qui tam_ lawsuits through
which any person (the “qui tam relator”) may bring a civil action for himself or herself and on behalf of the US
Government for any violation of the False Claims Act. If the qui tam relator ultimately wins the lawsuit or if there


21


is a settlement of the lawsuit, he or she may share in a portion of any money recovered with the government
and receive reimbursement for reasonable expenses, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Please note recovery
by the qui tam relator is uncertain and dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the case.


**f.** **Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.SC. 1320a-7a)**

Authorizes penalties and assessments on individuals and entities that submit false or fraudulent claims, or
engage in other types of specified misconduct. False Claims Act: Imposes liability on any person who submits a

business (Medicare or Medicaid).


ii. Criminal penalties and administrative sanctions for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute include fines, jail
terms, and exclusion from participation in the Federal health care programs. Safe harbors protect
certain payment and business practices that could otherwise implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute from
criminal and civil prosecution. To be protected by a safe harbor, an arrangement must fit squarely in the
safe harbor and satisfy all of its requirements. Some safe harbors address personal services and rental
agreements, investments in ambulatory surgical centers, and payments to bona fide employees.


**h.** **Physician Self-Referral Law (“Stark Law”), 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn**


i. The Physician Self-Referral Law (Stark Law) prohibits physicians from referring patients to receive

designated health services (DHS) payable by Medicare or Medicaid from entities with which the
physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, unless an exception applies. It
also prohibits entities from presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare or Medicaid for

those referred services.

ii. Criminal penalties include fines up to $25,000 per violation and up to 5 years in prison per violation. Civil

penalties include False Claims Act liability, civil monetary penalties and program exclusion.


**i.** **Non-Retaliation Policy**


The False Claims Act forbids retaliation by an employer against an employee who cooperates with investigators
regarding potential False Claims Act violations or who commences qui tam actions in good faith. In accordance
with such laws and its Corporate Compliance Program, The Practice fully complies with all applicable “whistleblower” protections. ii. The False Claims Act specifically provides that any employee who is discharged,
demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and
conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the
employer or others in furtherance of an action under the False Claims Act, including investigation for, initiation
of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under the False Claims Act, shall be entitled to all
relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief may include reinstatement with the same seniority
status the employee would have enjoyed but for the discrimination; two times the amount of back pay;
interest on back pay; and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination,


22


including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. The New York State False Claims Act has similar nonretaliation protections.


**j.** **New York State Social Services Law § 145-b: False Statements**


i. Under New York Social Services Law § 145-b, it is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to

knowingly by means of a false statement or representation (defined below), or by deliberate

levels of offenses, generally depending on the value of the false claim. A person is guilty of aggravated insurance
fraud when he commits a fraudulent insurance act, and has been previously convicted within the preceding five
years of any offense also involving a fraudulent insurance act.


**r.** **Health Care Fraud Under Article 177 of the New York Penal Law**


i. Penal Law Article 177 also involves offenses of health care fraud. Under Article 177, a person is guilty

of health care fraud when, with the intent to defraud a health plan (including Medicaid), he or she
knowingly and willfully provides materially false information or omits material information for the purpose
of requesting payment from a health plan for items or services and, as a result of such information or
omission, payment is received for which he/she or another person is not entitled. There are five levels of
offenses, depending on the value of the fraudulent claims.


ii. It is a defense for crimes under Article 177 that the defendant was a clerk, bookkeeper or other

employee (other than an employee charged with active management and control, in an executive
capacity, of the affairs of the corporation) who, without personal benefit, merely executed the orders of
his or her employer/supervisor.


**s.** **Insurance Frauds Prevention**


24


Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law prohibits an individual, firm, association or corporation from
committing a fraudulent insurance act as defined in Penal Law § 176.05. Violators may be subject to both
criminal liability and money penalties.


**t.** **31 U.S. Code § 3730 (h). Relief from Retaliatory Actions**

Any employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or
agent whole, if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed,
or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts
done by the employee, contractor, agent or associated others in furtherance of an action under this section (31

U.S.

[Code § 3730) or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of this subchapter (Subchapter III. CLAIMS AGAINST](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/subtitle-III/chapter-37/subchapter-III)
[THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT).](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/subtitle-III/chapter-37/subchapter-III)


Relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status that employee, contractor, or agent would have
had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for
any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable
attorneys’ fees. An action under this subsection may be brought in the appropriate district court of the United
States for the relief provided in this subsection. A civil action under this subsection may not be brought more
than 3 years after the date when the retaliation occurred.


**u.** **Employee Whistleblower Protection Rights/Non-Retaliation**


i. **Crouse Medical Practice’s Non-Retaliation Policy** . The False Claims Act forbids retaliation by an employer

against an employee who cooperates with investigators regarding potential False Claims Act violations or
who commences qui tam actions in good faith. In accordance with such laws and its Corporate Compliance
Program, the Practice fully complies with all applicable “whistle-blower” protections

ii. **Specific False Claims Act Protection** . The False Claims Act specifically provides that any employee who is

discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the
terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee
on behalf of the employer or others in furtherance of an action under the False Claims Act, including
investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under the False
Claims Act, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief may include
reinstatement with the same seniority status the employee would have enjoyed but for the discrimination;
two times the amount of back pay; interest on back pay; and compensation for any special damages
sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.


iii. **New York Labor Laws Prohibiting Retaliatory Actions.** Two Laws prohibiting employer retaliation against

employees are addressed below. The first is Labor Law § 740 and applies to employers in general. The
second is Labor Law § 741, and is specific to health care providers.


a. **Labor Law § 740.** This law prohibits retaliatory action by an employer against an employee who discloses

or who threatens to disclose, to a supervisor or to a public body, an activity, policy or practice of the
employer that the employee reasonably believes to be in violation of law, rule or regulation or that the
employee reasonably believes poses a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety.


25


"Employee" means an individual who performs services for and under the control and direction of an
employer for wages or other remuneration, including former employees, or natural persons employed as
independent contractors to carry out work in furtherance of an employer's business enterprise who are
not themselves employers.


1. The protection against retaliatory action provided above pertaining to disclosure to a public body
only applies where the employee has first made a good faith effort to notify his or her employer
by bringing the activity, policy or practice believed to be in violation of law, rule or regulation to
the attention of a supervisor of the employer and has afforded such employer a reasonable
opportunity to correct such activity, policy or practice. Such employer notification shall not be
required where:

a. there is an imminent and serious danger to the public health or safety;
b. the employee reasonably believes that reporting to the supervisor would result in a

destruction of evidence or other concealment of the activity, policy or practice;
c. such activity, policy or practice could reasonably be expected to lead to endangering the

welfare of a minor;
d. the employee reasonably believes that reporting to the supervisor would result in

physical harm to the employee or any other person; or (e) the employee reasonably
believes that the supervisor is already aware of the activity, policy or practice and will
not correct such activity, policy or practice.
2. Labor Law § 740 also prohibits an employer from taking retaliatory action against an employee
who provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation,
hearing or inquiry into any such activity, policy or practices by such employer. In addition, an
employer may not take retaliatory action against an employee who objects to, or refuses to
participate in any such activity, policy or practice.
3. For purposes of Labor Law §740, “retaliatory action” means an adverse action taken by an
employer or his or her agent to discharge, threaten, penalize, or in any other manner
discriminate against any employee or former employee exercising his or her rights under this
section, including (i) adverse employment actions or threats to take such adverse employment
actions against an employee in the terms of conditions of employment including but not limited
to discharge, suspension, or demotion; (ii) actions or threats to take such actions that would
adversely impact a former employee's current or future employment; or (iii) threatening to
contact or contacting United States immigration authorities or otherwise reporting or
threatening to report an employee's suspected citizenship or immigration status or the
suspected citizenship or immigration status of an employee's family or household member, as
defined in subdivision two of section four hundred fifty nine-a of the social services law, to a
federal, state, or local agency.
4. An employee who has been the subject of a retaliatory action in violation of Labor Law § 740 may
commence a civil court action within two years after the alleged retaliatory action was taken. The
court may order relief as follows:

a. an injunction to restrain the employer’s continued violation;
b. the reinstatement of the employee to the same position held before the retaliatory

action, or to an equivalent position, or front pay in lieu thereof;
c. the reinstatement of full fringe benefits and seniority rights;
d. compensation for lost wages, benefits, and other remuneration;
e. payment by the employer of reasonable costs, disbursements, and attorney’s fees;
f. a civil penalty of an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars; and/or


26


g. the payment by the employer of punitive damages, if the violation was willful, malicious


or wanton.

5. Labor Law § 740 does not diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies of any employee under any
other law or regulation or under any collective bargaining agreement or employment contract.
6. Employer relief. A court, in its discretion, may also order that reasonable attorneys' fees and
court costs and disbursements be awarded to an employer if the court determines that an action
brought by an employee under this section was without basis in law or in fact.

b. **Labor Law § 741.** This law prohibits retaliatory action by _certain health care_ employers against a health

care employee who discloses or who threatens to disclose, to a supervisor or to a public body, an
activity, policy or practice of the employer or employer’s agent that the employee, in good faith
reasonably believes constitutes improper quality of patient care. Labor Law § 741 also prohibits
retaliatory action by such employer if the employee objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity,
policy or practice of the employer that the employee, in good faith, reasonably believes constitutes
improper quality of patient care.


1. Protection against retaliatory action does not apply unless the employee has first
notified the employer of the improper quality of patient care and has afforded the
employer a reasonable opportunity to correct such activity, policy or practice.
However, such notice is not required if there is an imminent threat to public health or
safety or to the health of a specific patient and the employee reasonably believes in
good faith that reporting to a supervisor would not result in corrective action.
2. For purposes of Labor Law § 741, "retaliatory action" means the discharge, suspension,
demotion, penalization or discrimination against an employee, or other adverse
employment action taken against an employee in the terms and conditions of
employment.
3. Under Labor Law § 741, an employee has two years from the date of the alleged
retaliatory action to commence a lawsuit. In addition to the remedies that may be
available to the employee a court may assess a fine up to $10,000 against the
employer if the court finds that the employer acted in bad faith. These fines are not
paid to the employee, but will be deposited into a state-wide fund to improve patient

care.
