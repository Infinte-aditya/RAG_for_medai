_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_

_Introduction_

## **Introduction**


_**Applicability**_

This Health Center Program Compliance Manual (“Compliance Manual”) applies to all health
centers that apply for [1] or receive Federal award funds under the Health Center Program
[authorized by section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) (“section](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section254b&num=0&edition=prelim)
330”), as amended (including sections 330(e), (g), (h), and (i)), as well as subrecipient
organizations [2] and Health Center Program look-alikes. Look-alikes do not receive Federal

funding under section 330 of the PHS Act; however, to receive look-alike designation and
associated Federal benefits, look-alikes must meet the Health Center Program requirements. [3 ]

For the purposes of this document, the term “health center” refers to entities that apply for or
receive a Federal award under section 330 of the PHS Act (including sections 330 (e), (g), (h)
and (i)), section 330 subrecipients, and organizations designated as look-alikes.

This Compliance Manual does not apply to activities conducted outside of a health center’s
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-approved scope of project. [4 ]


_**Purpose**_

The purpose of the Compliance Manual is to provide a consolidated resource to assist health
centers in understanding and demonstrating compliance with Health Center Program
requirements. The Compliance Manual also addresses HRSA’s approach to determining
eligibility for and exercising oversight over the Health Center Program and details the
requirements for obtaining deemed PHS employee status under section 224 (g)-(n) and (q) of
the PHS Act. [5 ]


The Compliance Manual identifies requirements found in the Health Center Program’s
authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, as well as certain applicable grants
regulations. [6 ] These requirements form the foundation of the Health Center Program and

support the core mission of this innovative and successful model of primary care. The
Compliance Manual does not provide guidance on requirements in areas beyond Health Center
Program requirements or outside HRSA’s oversight authority. In addition, the Compliance


1 Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) may include specified timelines for new awardees to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements specified in this Manual following receipt of the Federal Health Center Program

award.

_Introduction_


Manual is not intended to address best or promising practices or performance improvement
strategies that may support effective operations or organizational excellence.

Health Center Program non-regulatory policy issuances that remain in effect after the release of
the Compliance Manual are listed in Appendix A. With the exception of these policies, the
Compliance Manual supersedes other previous Health Center Program non-regulatory policy
issuances (Policy Information Notices (PINs), Program Assistance Letters (PALs), Regional Office
Memoranda, Regional Program Guidance memoranda, and other non-regulatory materials)
related to Health Center Program compliance or eligibility requirements. In case of any conflict
between a provision of the Compliance Manual and other HRSA-disseminated non-regulatory
materials related to compliance and/or eligibility requirements, the provisions of the
Compliance Manual control. Previously published issuances that are superseded by this Manual
include, but are not limited to:


  - **PIN 1994-07**

  - **PINs 1997-27 and 1998-24**

  - **PINs 2001-16 and 2002-22**

  - **PAL 2006-01**

  - **PIN 2010-01**

  - **PIN 2013-01**

  - **PIN 2014-01**

  - **PIN 2014-02**

  - **PAL 2014-08** **[7 ]**


  - **PAL 2014-11**

The Compliance Manual serves as the foundation for HRSA’s eligibility and compliance-related
determinations and for HRSA’s review processes for the Health Center Program. HRSA will
update or amend the Compliance Manual as needed to provide further policy clarification with
respect to demonstrating compliance with Health Center Program requirements.

_**Structure of the Health Center Program Compliance Manual**_

Chapters in the Compliance Manual are generally organized as follows:


  **Authority** : Lists the applicable statutory and regulatory citations. [8 ]


  - **Requirements** : States the statutory and regulatory requirements.


7 PAL 2014-08 superseded PAL 2010-01, “Enhancements to Support Health Center Program Requirements
Monitoring,” which was issued April 8, 2010.

8 These citations include requirements under the Uniform Administrative Requirements for all HHS awards (45 CFR
Part 75) which are applicable to organizations receiving Federal funding under the Health Center Program (45
C.F.R. 75.101).

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_

_Introduction_


  - **Demonstrating Compliance** : Describes how health centers would demonstrate to HRSA
their compliance with the **Requirements** by fulfilling all elements in this section.


_**Note**_ _: Health centers that fail to demonstrate compliance as described in this_
_Manual will receive a condition of award/designation. In responding to such_
_conditions, health centers could demonstrate their compliance to HRSA either by_
_submitting documentation as described in the Demonstrating Compliance sections_
_of the Manual or by the health center proposing an alternative means of_
_demonstrating compliance with the specified Requirements, which would include_
_submitting an explanation and documentation that explicitly demonstrate_
_compliance. All responses to conditions are subject to review and approval by HRSA_
_(see Chapter 2:_ _Health Center Program Oversight)._


  - **Related Considerations** : Describes areas where health centers have discretion with

respect to decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when
implementing a requirement. When specific examples are provided, they are not

intended to be an all-inclusive list. All related considerations are offered with the

understanding that health center decision-making and implementation are consistent
with all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements.

_**Additional Health Center Responsibilities**_

In addition to the requirements included in this Compliance Manual, organizations receiving
Health Center Program Federal awards, including subrecipients, are also subject to other
applicable award-related statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements (see 45 CFR Part 75 and
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Grants Policy Statement (GPS), [9]
Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs), [10] and Notices of Award (NoAs)). As such, the

Compliance Manual does not constitute an exhaustive listing of all requirements that may be
included in terms and conditions stated in NOFOs, NoAs, and other applicable laws, regulations,
and policies.

Health centers (including look-alikes) are subject to the distinct statutory, regulatory, and policy
requirements of other Federal programs that they may be eligible for and participate in as a
result of the Health Center Program award or designation, such as:


  - Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) status, payment rates, and requirements

under Titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act; [11 ]

  - The 340B Drug Pricing Program; [12 ]


9 Further grants policy information may be found in the HHS Grants Policy Statement and the HRSA SF-424
[Application Guide. See HRSA Grants](https://www.hrsa.gov/grants) for more information.
10 Individual NOFOs may contain specific additional terms and conditions of award beyond those identified in this

Manual.

_Chapter 1: Health Center Program Eligibility_

## **Chapter 1: Health Center Program Eligibility**


Organizations applying for funding or designation under the Health Center Program must
demonstrate that they are eligible organizations under the Health Center Program statute and
regulations. Specifically, organizations applying for funding as health centers or designation as
look-alikes must be private non-profit entities or public agencies. [1 ] Organizations applying for

look-alike designation are also subject to certain additional statutory eligibility requirements. [2 ]


_**In addition to the eligibility requirements described in this Chapter, organizations may be**_
_**required to comply with certain additional eligibility requirements described in Notices of**_
_**Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) or look-alike application instructions in order to receive a**_
_**Health Center Program award or look-alike designation.**_

_**Non-Profit Organizations**_


An organization would demonstrate to HRSA that it is a private non-profit entity by
submitting one of the following types of documentation:

  - A copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate;


  - A statement from a state taxing body, state attorney general, or other appropriate state
official certifying that the applicant organization has a non-profit status and that none of
the net earnings accrue to any private shareholders or individuals;

  - A certified copy of the organization’s official certificate of incorporation or similar
document (for example, articles of incorporation) showing the state or tribal seal that
clearly establishes nonprofit status; or

  - Any of the above documents for a state or local office of a national parent organization
and a statement signed by the parent organization that the applicant organization is a
local non-profit affiliate.

_**Public Agency Organizations**_


An organization would demonstrate to HRSA that it is a public agency by submitting one of
the following types of documentation:


  - A current dated letter affirming the organization’s status as a State, territorial, county,
city, or municipal government; a health department organized at the State, territory,
county, city or municipal level; or a subdivision or municipality of a United States (U.S.)

affiliated sovereign State formally associated with the U.S. (for example, Republic of
Palau);

  - A copy of the law that created the organization and that grants one or more sovereign
powers (for example, the power to tax, eminent domain, police power) to the
organization (for example, a public hospital district);

  - A ruling from the State Attorney General affirming the legal status of an entity as either
a political subdivision or instrumentality of the State (for example, a public university);

or

  - A “letter ruling” which provides a positive written determination by the Internal
Revenue Service of the organization’s exempt status as an instrumentality under

Internal Revenue Code section 115.

_**Tribal or Urban Indian Organizations**_
Native American tribal organizations, including those defined under the Indian SelfDetermination Act [3] or the Indian Health Care Improvement Act [4], [5] are eligible to apply for
Health Center Program funding or designation. Such organizations would demonstrate their

eligibility to HRSA by providing applicable documentation as described in either the Non-Profit
Organizations or Public Agency Organizations sections above.

_**Additional Eligibility Requirements for Look-Alike Designation**_

In addition to demonstrating that it is either a private non-profit entity or a public agency, an
organization applying for look-alike designation must demonstrate to HRSA that it satisfies all of
the following requirements:


1. It is currently delivering primary health care services to patients within the proposed


service area.

2. It is not owned, controlled, or operated by another entity. Specifically, the organization
applying for look-alike designation:


a. **Owns and controls** the organization’s assets and liabilities (for example, the
organization does not have a sole corporate member, is not a subsidiary of
another organization), and as such will be able to ensure that the benefits that
accrue through look-alike designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center
(FQHC) are distributed to the Health Center Program project (for example, FQHC

requirements.

payment rates, 340B Drug Pricing); and

b. **Operates** the Health Center Program project. At a minimum, the look-alike
applicant organization demonstrates that it maintains a Project Director/Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) who will carry out independent, day-to-day oversight of
health center activities solely on behalf of the governing board of the applicant
organization.


3. It is not currently receiving funding as a Health Center Program Federal award

recipient. [6 ]


_Organizations will not be awarded Federal funding or look-alike designation that would_
_result in “dual status,” whereby the organization becomes both a Federal awardee under_
_section 330 and a look-alike designee._ _For example, an organization that is currently a_
_Health Center Program awardee would no longer be awarded new look-alike designation_
_status through the Initial Designation process, nor would an organization that is_
_currently a Health Center Program look-alike be awarded Health Center Program_
_funding unless, at the same time, it proposes to include all of its health center_ _sites_
_within the scope of the Health Center Program award._

_Health centers that currently have dual status as of the date of release of the_
_Compliance manual will be permitted to maintain such status as long as subsequent_
_Service Area Competition and Renewal of Designation applications are approved by_

_HRSA._


6 Health centers may not maintain or obtain look-alike designation if they are already receiving a Federal award
under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. Under Section 1905(l)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act: “The term
“Federally-qualified health center” means an entity which … (i) is receiving a grant under section 254b of this
title…or (ii)(I) is receiving funding from such a grant under a contract with the recipient of such a grant, and (II)
meets the requirements to receive a grant under section 254b of this title…or (iii) based on the recommendation
of the Health Resources and Services Administration within the Public Health Service, is determined by the
Secretary to meet the requirements for receiving such a grant, including requirements of the Secretary that an
entity may not be owned, controlled, or operated by another entity.”

_Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight_

## **Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight**


_Note: This chapter contains revisions based on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018._ _[View the](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/compliance/healthcentercompliancemanual-revisions.pdf)_
_[revisions](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/compliance/healthcentercompliancemanual-revisions.pdf)_ _(PDF)._

Health centers must comply with all Health Center Program requirements and other applicable
Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of their award or look-alike
designation. [1 ] In keeping with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)/Bureau

of Primary Health Care’s (BPHC) oversight responsibilities, HRSA/BPHC monitors and supports
health centers in complying with these requirements.

The purpose of this chapter is to:


  Set forth HRSA/BPHC’s oversight process for the purposes of monitoring compliance
with Health Center Program requirements and assists health centers in maintaining
compliance with these requirements.

  - Describe when and how HRSA pursues remedies for non-compliance, including taking
enforcement action(s) in cases where health centers fail to comply with Health Center
Program requirements and other applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms
and conditions of the award or look-alike designation.

  - Clarify when and how compliance with program requirements and past performance [2] is
considered in award or designation decisions.


HRSA/BPHC’s Progressive Action process is implemented through its Electronic Handbooks
(EHB) system. The EHB system facilitates the tracking of compliance with program conditions
placed on a health center’s award or designation. [3 ] This system also communicates these

conditions through Notices of Award (NoAs) or Notices of Look-Alike Designation (NLDs),
documents the health center’s response to these conditions, and documents removal of these
conditions when appropriate. [4 ]


_**Program Oversight**_

United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grants regulations,
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal
Awards (Uniform Regulations) [5] require HRSA to “manage and administer the Federal award in a


1 Section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), as amended, 42 CFR Part 51c, 42 CFR Part 56,

and 45 CFR Part 75.

2 42 CFR 51c.305 and 45 CFR 75.205(c)(3).

3 Throughout this document, requirements or conditions of award are “requirements of Federal designation” for
organizations designated by HRSA as look-alikes (see section 1861(aa)(4)(B) and section 1905(l)(2)(B) of the Social
Security Act), which must also meet all of the requirements of the Health Center Program.

4 In the EHB, a health center’s response to a condition of award/designation is referred to as a “submission”. The
removal or lifting of a condition occurs once a submission that adequately addresses the required corrective action
has been reviewed, approved by HRSA, and marked as “met” within the EHB.

manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are
implemented in full accordance with U.S. statutory and public policy requirements, including,
but not limited to, those protecting public welfare, the environment, and prohibiting
discrimination.” [6]


Consistent with applicable laws and HRSA’s program oversight responsibilities, health centers
are assessed for compliance with these requirements and are provided an opportunity to
remedy areas of non-compliance whenever reasonably possible. Immediate enforcement
action may be taken against health centers in limited circumstances that are further addressed

below.

HRSA may impose specific award conditions [7] if an applicant or recipient/designee:


  - Demonstrates undue risk in such areas [8] as:


`◦` Financial stability;
`◦` Quality of management systems and ability to meet required management
standards;
`◦` History of performance, specifically the applicant’s record in managing previous
Federal awards (timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements
and conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards);
`◦` Findings from reports and audits; and
`◦` Ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements
imposed on non-Federal entities.

  - Has a history of failure to comply with the general or specific terms and conditions of a
Federal award/designation;

  - Fails to meet expected performance goals [as prescribed in the terms or conditions of
the Federal award or designation]; or

  - Is not otherwise responsible. [9 ]


Specific award conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:


  - Requiring payments as reimbursements rather than advance payments; [10 ]

  - Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase of the project until receipt of
evidence of acceptable performance within a given period of performance;

  - Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;

  - Requiring additional project monitoring;

8 45 CFR 75.205(c).

9 45 CFR 75.207(a).

10 This is also known as “Restricted Drawdown.” When a Federal award recipient is placed on restricted drawdown,
all drawdowns of Federal funds from the Payment Management System (PMS) must have approval of HRSA’s
Office of Federal Assistance Management, Division of Grants Management Operations, and must comply with all
applicable requirements before funds are drawn.

_Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight_


  - Requiring the non-Federal entity to obtain technical or management assistance; or

  - Establishing additional prior approvals. [11 ]


If it is determined that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing such additional
conditions, one or more of the following actions may be taken as appropriate in the

circumstances:


  - Temporarily withhold cash payments pending further action;

  - Disallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;

  - Wholly or partly suspend award activities or terminate the Federal award; [12 ]

  - Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings; [13 ]

  - Withhold further Federal awards for the project or program; or

  - Take other remedies that may be legally available. [14 ]

In circumstances where HRSA has determined that a health center has failed to demonstrate

compliance with one or more of the Health Center Program requirements, a condition(s) will be
placed on the award/designation, which will follow the Progressive Action policy and process.
Such determinations are typically based upon findings from the review of the Service Area
Competition (SAC)/Renewal of Designation (RD) application, a site visit, other compliancerelated activities, or through other means. [15 ] Program conditions placed on the health center’s

award or look-alike designation describe the:


  - Nature of the finding and the requirement it relates to;

  - Reason why the condition(s) is being imposed;

  - Nature of the action(s) needed to remove the condition;

  - Time allowed for completing the additional requirement (satisfying the condition(s)
through submission of appropriate documentation or specific actions taken), if
applicable; and


11 45 CFR 75.207(b).

12 _Termination_ means the ending of a Federal award, in whole or in part at any time prior to the planned end of
period of performance [project period] (45 CFR 75.2). Health Center Program look-alikes will receive formal
notification of de-designation as they do not receive a Federal Health Center Program award.

13 _Suspension of award activities_ means an action by HRSA requiring the recipient to cease all activities on the
award pending corrective action by the recipient, including restricting the ability to draw down any funds
associated with the Federal award (45 CFR 75.375) and is a separate action from suspension under HHS regulations
(2 CFR Part 376) (45 CFR 75.2).

14 45 CFR 75.371.

15 HRSA may also assess compliance with requirements through audit data, Uniform Data System (UDS) or similar
performance reports, Medicare/Medicaid reports, external accreditation, or other Federal, state, or local findings
or reports as applicable, and may conduct onsite verification of compliance at any point within a
project/designation period or prior to any final Health Center Program award/designation decisions.

_Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight_


  - Method for requesting reconsideration of the condition. [16]


HRSA is committed to providing a reasonable period of time for these organizations to take
corrective actions necessary to demonstrate compliance. Progressive Action is designed to
provide a time-phased approach for resolution of compliance issues with program
requirements. This Progressive Action process is not intended to address or be used for the
oversight and enforcement of all Federal requirements that may be applicable to the award or
designation, particularly those with implications for patient safety (see Immediate Enforcement
Actions below).

Should a health center fail to adequately address conditions through Progressive Action, HRSA
may utilize available remedies, including terminating all or part of the Federal
award/designation status before the health center’s current project end date. [17] Such action

may be accompanied by a competition to identify another organization to carry out a service
delivery program consistent with Federal requirements. [18]


_**Progressive Action Process**_

In circumstances where HRSA has determined that a health center has failed to demonstrate

compliance with one or more Health Center Program requirements, relevant conditions are
placed on the health center’s award/designation and communicated through Notices of Award
(NoAs) or Notices of Look-Alike Designation (NLDs). In responding to such conditions, health
centers could demonstrate their compliance to HRSA either by submitting documentation as
described in the Demonstrating Compliance sections of the Manual, or by the health center
proposing an alternative means of demonstrating compliance with the specified requirements,
which would include submitting an explanation and documentation that explicitly
demonstrates compliance. All responses to conditions are subject to review and approval by

HRSA.

The Progressive Action process provides a uniform structure and a time-phased approach for
notifying health centers of the failure to demonstrate compliance and for receiving health
center responses to an identified condition(s) as supported within HRSA’s EHB. Through this
process, health centers are able to efficiently and effectively respond to conditions, and HRSA is
able to promptly review these responses and proceed to next steps, including removal of
conditions, as warranted. In addition, the EHB supports the Progressive Action process by
clearly noting condition response deadlines in the health center’s EHB task list and providing
periodic reminders to health centers during the condition response timeframe.


16 Imposed conditions will include the method for submitting responses to conditions, which would include an
opportunity to inform HRSA of any request to reconsider the placement of the condition.

17 45 CFR 75.371 and 45 CFR 75.372.

18 Health Center Program look-alikes that have had their designation period terminated by HRSA under such
circumstances or for which HRSA has not renewed a look-alike designation may reapply for look-alike designation
through the initial designation application process at any time.


Page | 11


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight_


The Progressive Action process includes four distinct condition phases (detailed below),
structured to provide specified timeframes for health centers to provide responses that
demonstrate compliance, either in the manner prescribed by this Manual or via alternative
means. After initial notification of the compliance issue, a health center will be notified via a
NoA/NLD at each Progressive Action phase as to the acceptability of the response and whether
further action is needed. If the health center fails to respond by the specified deadline or HRSA
determines that the health center’s response does not demonstrate compliance, the health
center will be notified and the next Progressive Action phase will be activated.


  Phase One: An initial NoA/NLD is issued with a condition detailing the specific area(s)
where compliance with a requirement has not been demonstrated. Phase One provides
ninety (90) days for the health center to submit appropriate documentation that
demonstrates compliance or, where applicable, that the health center has developed an
adequate action plan (see Implementation Phase below) for how its organization will
demonstrate compliance with the requirement. [19 ]

  - Phase Two: Phase Two provides an additional sixty (60) days for the health center to
submit appropriate documentation that demonstrates compliance or that the health
center has developed an adequate action plan for how its organization will demonstrate
compliance with the requirement (See Implementation Phase below).

  - Phase Three: Phase Three provides an additional thirty (30) days for the health center to
submit appropriate documentation that demonstrates compliance or that the health
center has developed an adequate action plan for how its organization will demonstrate
compliance with the requirement (See Implementation Phase below).

  - Implementation Phase (where applicable): Implementation Phase provides one hundred
twenty (120) days for the health center to implement the HRSA-approved action plan
and submit appropriate documentation that demonstrates compliance with the
program requirement. [20 ]


HRSA recognizes that health centers may need to make programmatic and organizational
changes in response to a condition. Therefore, the Progressive Action process is designed to
provide health centers with a reasonable amount of time to take appropriate action in response
to a condition and for prompt HRSA review and decision-making. For example, in Phase One, a
health center is given 90 days to either demonstrate compliance with the identified program
requirement or develop and submit an action plan detailing the steps the health center will
implement in order to demonstrate compliance with the requirement. If this plan is approved, a
NoA/NLD will be issued with an “Implementation Phase” condition notifying the health center
that HRSA has approved the action plan and that within 120 days it must submit documentation
that compliance with the requirement has been demonstrated in accordance with the HRSAapproved plan.


19 Conditions afford a 120-day Implementation Phase when a HRSA-approved corrective action plan would require
additional time for the health center to implement related programmatic and organizational changes.

20 The implementation phase follows HRSA’s approval of an adequate action plan submitted in Phase One, Two, or

Three.

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight_


Conditions in Phase Two (60-day) and Phase Three (30-day) [21] state that if the health center
does not adequately address the condition within the allotted timeframe (the last opportunity
being Phase Three), the organization will be determined to have failed to comply with the
terms and conditions of the Health Center Program award or designation. As a result, the

health center’s current project end date may be shortened through the termination of all or
part of the Federal award or designation status.

_**Immediate Enforcement Actions**_

HRSA may determine that certain findings related to a health center, as a consequence of their
nature and/or urgency, cannot be remedied by imposing specific award conditions per the
Progressive Action process described above. In such cases, based on the circumstances, HRSA
may take one or more of the following immediate remedies:


  - Temporarily withhold cash payments (from the Federal award) pending further action;

  - Disallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;

  - Wholly or partly suspend award activities or terminate the Federal award;

  - Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings;

  - Withhold further Federal awards for the project or program; or

  - Take other remedies that may be legally available. [22 ]


Situations that cannot be remedied through use of the Progressive Action process and that may
require HRSA to apply such immediate enforcement actions include:


  - Findings that a health center, in responding to the terms or conditions of
award/designation, misrepresented the actions it took to correct areas of noncompliance. For example, a site visit reveals that HRSA lifted a Progressive Action
condition based on false or misrepresented information submitted by the health center.

  - Documented public health or welfare concerns. Examples may include threats to health
center patient safety, violations of state scope of practice regulations or guidelines,
inappropriate or illegal prescribing practices, lack of appropriate infection control
procedures, and occupational or environmental hazards.

  - Failure of the health center organization to demonstrate operational capacity to
continue or maintain its health center service delivery program. For example, a health
center has ceased operations and is no longer providing primary care services or is


21 The BPHC website includes a public Health Center Profile for each individual health center that displays data on
the status of a health center’s compliance with Health Center Program requirements based on the presence of any
active 60- and/or 30-day Progressive Action conditions. See [Health Center Program UDS Data Overview to view](https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/data-reporting/program-data?type=AWARDEE)

individual health center data.

providing only minimal services.

  - A determination that continued funding would not be in the best interest of the Federal
Government. For example, a health center organization’s inclusion as an excluded entity
on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General’s List
of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE) and/or inclusion on the System for Award
Management (SAM) Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), [23] or as an organization that is
not qualified per the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System
(FAPIIS). [24 ]


_**Program Compliance and Application Review and Selection**_

Project/designation period length is based on an assessment of a health center’s compliance
with program requirements. Therefore, an existing health center that fails to demonstrate
compliance with all Health Center Program requirements may only be awarded Federal Service
Area Competition (SAC) funding for a one-year project/designation period. [25 ]


Further, if a current Health Center Program Federal award recipient has been awarded two
consecutive one-year project periods as a result of noncompliance with any Health Center
Program requirements, and review of a subsequent SAC application would result in a third
consecutive one-year project period due to noncompliance with Program requirements, HRSA
will not fund a third consecutive one-year project period. [26 ] In such circumstances, HRSA may

announce a new competition for the service area, in order to identify an organization that can
carry out a service delivery program consistent with Health Center Program requirements.

Consistent with the approach regarding Federal award recipients, HRSA will not renew a Health
Center Program look-alike organization’s designation if the organization has received two
consecutive one-year designation periods and the review of the subsequent RD application
would result in a third consecutive one-year designation period. Look-alikes whose designation

25 Section 330(e)(1)(B) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(e)(1)(B)). In addition, a health center that fails to
demonstrate compliance with all Health Center Program requirements, including those in Section 330(k)(3) of the
PHS Act, must submit, within 120 days of grant funding, an implementation plan for compliance for HRSA approval.
Additional information related to this implementation plan will be included in the applicable Notices of Funding
Opportunity and Look-Alike Designation/Renewal of Designation application instructions.

26 Section 330(e)(4) of the PHS Act states that “Not more than two grants may be made under subparagraph (B) of
paragraph (1) for the same entity.” While such organizations may apply for future Health Center Program funding
under 45 CFR 75.205(c)(3), HRSA may consider factors, including an applicant’s history of performance if it has
been a prior recipient of Federal awards or designation when making competitive awards. These factors include,
but are not limited to, unsuccessful Progressive Action condition resolution and current compliance with Health
Center Program requirements and regulations.

period has not been renewed may reapply for look-alike designation through the initial
designation application process at any time. [27]


In addition, project/designation period length determinations may be impacted by a
comprehensive evaluation of the risks to the Health Center Program posed by each applicant if
it were to receive an award/designation for a new project or designation period, or for
supplemental funding. The specific criteria for determining project period length are further
detailed in the applicable Service Area Competition (SAC) Notices of Funding Opportunity
(NOFOs) and Look-Alike Renewal of Designation (RD), or supplemental funding application
instructions. A health center’s ability to demonstrate compliance with program requirements is
critical to ensuring continued Federal award support and may, in certain cases, directly impact
award decisions for supplemental funding, as outlined in the specific NOFO.

  - The health center must define and annually review the boundaries of the catchment
area to be served [service area], including the identification of the medically
underserved population or populations within the catchment area in order to ensure

that the:


`◦` Size of this area is such that the services to be provided through the center

a. The health center identifies and annually reviews its service area [1] based on where
current or proposed patient populations reside as documented by the ZIP codes
reported on the health center’s Form 5B: Service Sites. In addition, these service area



reported on the health center’s Form 5B: Service Sites. In addition, these service area

ZIP codes are consistent with patient origin data reported by ZIP code in its annual
Uniform Data System (UDS) report (for example, the ZIP codes reported on the health
center’s Form 5B: Service Sites would include the ZIP codes in which at least 75 percent
of current health center patients reside, as identified in the most recent UDS report).

b. The health center completes or updates a needs assessment of the current or proposed
population at least once every three years, [2] for the purposes of informing and improving
the delivery of health center services. The needs assessment utilizes the most recently



the delivery of health center services. The needs assessment utilizes the most recently

available data [3] for the service area and, if applicable, special populations and addresses
the following:



`◦` Factors associated with access to care and health care utilization (for example,
geography, transportation, occupation, transience, unemployment, income level,
educational attainment);
`◦` The most significant causes of morbidity and mortality (for example, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, low birth weight, behavioral health) as well as
any associated health disparities; and
`◦` Any other unique health care needs or characteristics that impact health status
or access to, or utilization of, primary care (for example, social factors, the
physical environment, cultural/ethnic factors, language needs, housing status).

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making, or may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines the most appropriate methodologies, tools, and formats
for conducting needs assessments (for example, quantitative or qualitative data sources,


1 Also referred to as “catchment area” in the Health Center Program implementing regulation in 42 CFR 51c.102.

2 Compliance may be demonstrated based on the information included in a Service Area Competition (SAC) or a
Renewal of Designation (RD) application. Note that in the case of a Notice of Funding Opportunity for a New
Access Point or Expanded Services grant, HRSA may specify application-specific requirements for demonstrating an
applicant has consulted with the appropriate agencies and providers consistent with Section 330(k)(2)(D) of the
Public Health Service Act. Such application-specific requirements may require a completed or updated needs
assessment more recent than that which was provided in an applicant’s SAC or RD application.

3 In cases where data are not available for the specific service area or special population, health centers may use
extrapolation techniques to make valid estimates using data available for related areas and population groups.
Extrapolation is the process of using data that describes one population to estimate data for a comparable
population, based on one or more common differentiating demographic characteristics. Where data are not
directly available and extrapolation is not feasible, health centers should use the best available data describing the
area or population to be served.

focus groups, patient surveys).

- The health center determines how to complete or update its needs assessments (for
example, fulfilling the criteria of a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), participating
in community-wide needs assessments, responding to changes within the community).

- The health center may choose to include additional indicators relevant to its service
area and population within its needs assessments.

- The health center may choose to include an additional focus on a specific underserved
subset of the service area population (for example, children; persons living with
HIV/AIDS; elderly persons), as part of its overall assessment of need in its service area.

a. The health center provides access to all services included in its HRSA-approved scope of

project [1] (Form 5A: Services Provided) through one or more service delivery methods, [2]
as described below: [3 ]


`◦` _**Direct**_ : If a required or additional service is provided directly by health center
employees [4] or volunteers, this service is accurately recorded in Column I on
Form 5A: Services Provided, reflecting that the health center pays for and bills

for direct care.


`◦` _**Formal Written Contract/Agreement:**_ _**[5]**_ If a required or additional service is
provided on behalf of the health center via a formal contract/agreement
between the health center and a third party (including a subrecipient), [6] this
service is accurately recorded in Column II on Form 5A: Services Provided,
reflecting that the health center pays for the care provided by the third party via
the agreement. In addition, the health center ensures that such contractual

agreements for services include:


1
In accordance with 45 CFR 75.308 (Uniform Administrative Requirements: Revision of Budget and Program Plans),
health centers must request prior approval from HRSA for a change in the scope or the objective of the project or
program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval). This prior approval
requirement applies, among other things, to the addition or deletion of a service within the scope of project. These
changes require prior approval from HRSA and must be submitted by the health center as a formal change in scope
[request. See Scope of Project for further details on scope of project, including descriptions of the services listed on](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/compliance/scope-project)
Form 5A: Services Provided [available at: Form 5A: Service Descriptors (PDF).](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/compliance/form-5a-service-descriptors.pdf)
2 The Health Center Program statute states that health centers may provide services “either through the staff and
supporting resources of the center or through contracts or cooperative arrangements.” 42 U.S.C. 254b(a)(1) The
Health Center Program Compliance Manual utilizes the terms “Formal Written Contract/Agreement” and “Formal
Written Referral Arrangement” to refer to such “contracts or cooperative arrangements.” For more information on
documenting service delivery methods within the HRSA-approved scope of project on Form 5A: Services Provided,
[see: Form 5A Column Descriptors](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/compliance/form-5a-column-descriptors.pdf) (PDF).
Other Health Center Program requirements apply when providing services through contractual agreements and
formal referral arrangements. Such requirements are addressed in other chapters of the Manual where applicable.
3 See Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program for more information on sliding fee discount program requirements
and how they apply to the various service delivery methods.

4 For purposes of the HRSA-approved scope of project (Form 5A: Services Provided), HRSA/BPHC utilizes Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) definitions to differentiate contractors and employees. Typically, an employee receives a
salary on a regular basis and a W-2 from the health center with applicable taxes and benefit contributions
withheld.

5 See Chapter 12: Contracts and Subawards for more information on program requirements around contracting.
6 For purposes of the HRSA-approved scope of project (Form 5A: Services Provided), services provided via
“contract/formal agreement” are those provided by practitioners who are not employed by or volunteers of the
health center (for example, an individual provider with whom the health center has a contract; a group practice
with which the health center has a contract; a locum tenens staffing agency with which the health center
contracts; a subrecipient organization). Typically, a health center will issue an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form
1099 to report payments to an individual contractor. [See the FTCA Health Center Policy Manual](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/technical-assistance/ftcahc-policy-manual.pdf) (PDF) for

        - How the service will be documented in the patient’s health center record;

and

        - How the health center will pay for the service.


`◦` _**Formal Written Referral Arrangement**_ : If access to a required or additional
service is provided and billed for by a third party with which the health center
has a formal referral arrangement, this service is accurately recorded in Column
III on Form 5A: Services Provided, reflecting that the health center is responsible
for the act of referral for health center patients and any follow-up care for these
patients provided by the health center subsequent to the referral. [7] In addition,

the health center ensures that such formal referral arrangements for services, at
a minimum, address:

        - The manner by which referrals will be made and managed; and

        - The process for tracking and referring patients back to the health center
for appropriate follow-up care (for example, exchange of patient record
information, receipt of lab results).


b. Health center patients with limited English proficiency are provided with interpretation

and translation (for example, through bilingual providers, on-site interpreters, high
quality video or telephone remote interpreting services) that enable them to have

reasonable access to health center services.

c. The health center makes arrangements and/or provides resources (for example,
training) that enable its staff to deliver services in a manner that is culturally sensitive
and bridges linguistic and cultural differences.

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center governing board determines which, if any, additional health services
to offer in order to meet the health needs of the population served by the health center
(subject to review and approval by HRSA).


7 For purposes of the HRSA-approved scope of project (Form 5A: Services Provided), access to services provided via
“formal referral arrangements” are those referred by the health center but provided and billed for by a third party.
Although the service itself is not included within the HRSA-approved scope of project, the act of referral and any
follow-up care provided by the health center subsequent to the referral are considered to be part of the health
center’s HRSA-approved scope of project. For more information on documenting service delivery methods within
[the HRSA-approved scope of project on Form 5A: Services Provided, see: Form 5A Column Descriptors](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/compliance/form-5a-column-descriptors.pdf) (PDF).

[of Project.](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/compliance/scope-project)

2 Clinical staff includes licensed independent practitioners (for example, Physician, Dentist, Physician Assistant,
Nurse Practitioner), other licensed or certified practitioners (for example, Registered Nurse, Licensed Practical
Nurse, Registered Dietitian, Certified Medical Assistant), and other clinical staff providing services on behalf of the
health center (for example, Medical Assistants or Community Health Workers in states, territories or jurisdictions
that do not require licensure or certification).
3 Health centers seeking coverage for themselves and their providers under the Health Center FTCA Medical
[Malpractice Program should review the statutory and policy requirements for coverage, as discussed in the FTCA](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/technical-assistance/ftcahc-policy-manual.pdf)

c. The health center has operating procedures for the initial and recurring review (for
example, every two years) of credentials for all clinical staff members (licensed
independent practitioners (LIPs), other licensed or certified practitioners (OLCPs), and
other clinical staff providing services on behalf of the health center) who are health
center employees, individual contractors, or volunteers. These credentialing procedures
would ensure verification of the following, as applicable:

`◦` Current licensure, registration, or certification using a primary source;
`◦` Education and training for initial credentialing, using:

        - Primary sources for LIPs [4 ]

        - Primary or other sources (as determined by the health center) for OLCPs
and any other clinical staff;
`◦` Completion of a query through the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB); [5 ]

`◦` Clinical staff member’s identity for initial credentialing using a governmentissued picture identification;
`◦` Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration; and
`◦` Current documentation of basic life support training.


d. The health center has operating procedures for the initial granting and renewal (for
example, every two years) of privileges for clinical staff members (LIPs, OLCPs, and other
clinical staff providing services on behalf of the health center) who are health center
employees, individual contractors, or volunteers. These privileging procedures would
address the following:

`◦` Verification of fitness for duty, immunization, and communicable disease status; [6 ]

`◦` For initial privileging, verification of current clinical competence via training,
education, and, as available, reference reviews;
`◦` For renewal of privileges, verification of current clinical competence via peer
review or other comparable methods (for example, supervisory performance
reviews); and
`◦` Process for denying, modifying or removing privileges based on assessments of
clinical competence and/or fitness for duty.

e. The health center maintains files or records for its clinical staff (for example, employees,
individual contractors, and volunteers) that contain documentation of licensure,
credentialing verification, and applicable privileges, consistent with operating
procedures.


4 In states in which the licensing agency, specialty board or registry conducts primary source verification of
education and training, the health center would not be required to duplicate primary source verification when
completing the credentialing process.

5 The NPDB is an electronic information repository authorized by Congress. It contains information on medical
malpractice payments and certain adverse actions related to health care practitioners, entities, providers, and
[suppliers. For more information, see National Practitioner Data Bank.](https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/)

6 Many states have their own recommendations or standards for provider immunization and communicable
disease screening.

_Chapter 5: Clinical Staffing_


f. If the health center has contracts with provider organizations (for example, group

practices, locum tenens staffing agencies, training programs) or formal, written referral
agreements with other provider organizations that provide services within its scope of
project, the health center ensures [7] that such providers are:

`◦` Licensed, certified, or registered as verified through a credentialing process, in
accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws; and
`◦` Competent and fit to perform the contracted or referred services, as assessed
through a privileging process.

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines its staffing composition (for example, use of nurse
practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives) and its staffing levels (for
example, full- and/or part-time staff).


  - The health center determines who has approval authority for credentialing and
privileging of its clinical staff.

  - The health center determines how credentialing will be implemented (for example, a
health center may contract with a credentials verification organization (CVO) to perform
credentialing activities or it may have its own staff conduct credentialing), including
whether to have separate credentialing processes for LIPs versus other provider types.


  - The health center determines how it assesses clinical competence and fitness for duty of
its staff (for example, regarding clinical competence, a health center may utilize peer
review conducted by its own providers or may contract with another organization to
conduct peer review).

  - The health center determines (consistent with its established privileging criteria)
whether to deny, modify, or remove privileges of its staff; whether to use an appeals
process in conjunction with such determinations; and whether to implement corrective
action plans in conjunction with the denial, modification, or removal of privileges.

  The health center determines (consistent with its contracts/cooperative arrangements)
whether to disallow individual providers or organizations from providing health services

on the health center’s behalf.


7 This may be done, for example, through provisions in contracts and cooperative arrangements with such
organizations or health center review of the organizations’ credentialing and privileging processes.

## **Chapter 6: Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation**


_**Authority**_

_Section 330(k)(3)(A) of the PHS Act; and 42 CFR 51c.303(a) and 42 CFR 56.303(a)_

_**Requirements**_


  - The required primary health services of the health center must be available and

accessible in the catchment [service] area of the center promptly, as appropriate, and in
a manner which ensures continuity of service to the residents of the center’s catchment

area.

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following**_ :


a. The health center’s service site(s) are accessible to the patient population relative to

where this population lives or works (for example, in areas immediately accessible to
public housing for health centers targeting public housing residents, or in shelters for
health centers targeting individuals experiencing homelessness, or at agricultural worker
housing for health centers targeting agricultural workers). Specifically, the health center
considers the following factors to ensure the accessibility of its sites:

`◦` Access barriers (for example, barriers resulting from the area's physical
characteristics, residential patterns, or economic and social groupings); and
`◦` Distance and time taken for patients to travel to or between service sites in
order to access the health center’s full range of in-scope services.

b. The health center’s total number and scheduled hours of operation across its service
sites are responsive to patient needs by facilitating the ability to schedule appointments
and access the health center’s full range of services within the HRSA-approved scope of
project [1] (for example, a health center service site might offer extended evening hours 3
days a week based on input or feedback from patients who cannot miss work for
appointments during normal business hours).


1 Services provided by a health center are defined at the awardee/designee level, not by individual site. Thus, not
all services must be available at every health center service site; rather, health center patients must have
reasonable access to the full complement of services offered by the center as a whole, either directly or through
[formal written established arrangements. See Scope of Project for further details on scope of project, including](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/compliance/scope-project)
services and column descriptors listed on Form 5A: Services Provided.

_Chapter 6: Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation_


c. The health center accurately records the sites in its HRSA-approved scope of project [2] on
its Form 5B: Service Sites in HRSA’s Electronic Handbooks (EHB).


_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines which methods to use for obtaining patient input on the
accessibility of its service sites and hours of operation (for example, annual survey, focus
groups, input from patient board members).

  - The health center determines how to measure and consider distance and travel time to

or between the health center’s sites when assessing its impact on patient access to the

health center’s services.


  - The health center determines how to support patient access to the various service sites
included within its HRSA-approved scope of project (for example, whether to provide
patient transportation between service sites or use mobile service sites). The health
center also determines which service(s) to provide at each site within its HRSA-approved
scope of project.


2 In accordance with 45 CFR 75.308(c)(1)(i), health centers must request prior approval from HRSA for a “Change in
the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior
written approval).” This prior approval requirement applies to the addition, deletion, or replacement of a service
site. These changes require prior approval from HRSA and must be submitted by the health center as a formal
[change in scope request. See Scope of Project](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/compliance/scope-project) for further details on scope of project.

_**Requirements**_


  - To assure continuity of the required primary health services of the center, the health


center must have:


`◦` Provisions for promptly responding to patient medical emergencies during the
health center’s regularly scheduled hours; and
`◦` Clearly defined arrangements for promptly responding to patient medical
emergencies after the health center’s regularly scheduled hours.

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following**_ :


a. The health center has at least one staff member trained and certified in basic life

support present at each HRSA-approved service site (as documented on Form 5B:
Service Sites) to ensure the health center has the clinical capacity to respond to patient
medical emergencies [1] during the health center’s regularly scheduled hours of
operation. [2 ]


b. The health center has and follows its applicable operating procedures when responding
to patient medical emergencies during regularly scheduled hours of operation.

c. The health center has after-hours coverage operating procedures, which may include
formal arrangements [3] with non-health center providers/entities, that ensure:

`◦` Coverage is provided via telephone or face-to-face by an individual with the
qualification and training necessary to exercise professional judgment in
assessing a health center patient's need for emergency medical care;
`◦` Coverage includes the ability to refer patients either to a licensed independent
practitioner for further consultation or to locations such as emergency rooms or
urgent care facilities for further assessment or immediate care as needed; and


1 Medical emergencies may, for example, include those related to physical, oral, behavioral, or other emergent

health needs.

`◦` Patients, including those with limited English proficiency, [4] are informed of and

are able to access after-hours coverage, based on receiving after-hours coverage
information and instructions in the language(s), literacy levels, and formats
appropriate to the health center’s patient population needs.


d. The health center has documentation of after-hours calls and any necessary follow-up
resulting from such calls for the purposes of continuity of care. [5 ]


_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines the means by which after-hours coverage is provided to
health center patients. Examples include: telephone coverage by health center
providers, primary care services after hours to address urgent medical conditions on an
extended or 24-hour basis at certain service sites, after-hours phone coverage
arrangements with other community providers, [6] or “nurse call” lines.


  - The health center determines how to make patients aware of the availability of, and
procedures for, accessing professional coverage after hours. Examples include afterhours instructions that are: integrated into an automated message on the health
center’s main phone line explaining how to access after-hours coverage, posted on the
door of all health center service sites, provided as part of the initial patient registration
process, posted on the health center’s website, and/or provided as patient brochures or

cards.


4 Under Section 602 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Department of Health and Human Services
implementing regulations (45 C.F.R. Section 80.3(b)(2)), recipients of Federal financial assistance, including health
centers, must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to their programs, services, and activities by

_**Authority**_

_Section 330(k)(3)(G) of the PHS Act; 42 CFR 51c.303(f), 42 CFR 51c.303(g), 42 CFR 51c.303(u), 42_
_CFR 56.303(f), 42 CFR 56.303(g), and 42 CFR 56.303(u)_

_**Requirements**_


  - The health center must operate in a manner such that no patient shall be denied service
due to an individual’s inability to pay. [1 ]


  - The health center must prepare a schedule of fees or payments for the provision of its
services consistent with locally prevailing rates or charges and designed to cover its
reasonable costs of operation and must prepare a corresponding schedule of discounts

[sliding fee discount schedule (SFDS)] to be applied to the payment of such fees or
payments, by which discounts are adjusted on the basis of the patient's ability to pay.

  - The health center must establish systems for [sliding fee] eligibility determination.


  - The health center’s schedule of discounts must provide for:


`◦` A full discount to individuals and families with annual incomes at or below those

set forth in the most recent Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) [100 percent of the
FPG], except that nominal charges for service may be collected from such
individuals and families where imposition of such fees is consistent with project
goals; and
`◦` No discount to individuals and families with annual incomes greater than twice
those set forth in such Guidelines [200 percent of the FPG].

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following**_ :


1 See Chapter 16: Billing and Collections for more information on waiving or reducing charges due to a patient’s
inability to pay.


Page | 32


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program_


a. The health center has a sliding fee discount program [2] that applies to all required and

additional health services [3] within the HRSA-approved scope of project for which there
are distinct fees. [4 ]


b. The health center has board-approved policy(ies) for its sliding fee discount program
that apply uniformly to all patients and address the following areas:

`◦` Definitions of income [5] and family;

`◦` Assessment of all patients for sliding fee discount eligibility based only on
income and family size, including methods for making such assessments;
`◦` The manner in which the health center’s sliding fee discount schedule(s)
(SFDS(s)) will be structured in order to ensure that patient charges are adjusted
based on ability to pay; and
`◦` _Only applicable to health centers that choose to have a nominal charge for_
_patients at or below 100 percent of the FPG_ : The setting of a flat nominal
charge(s) at a level that would be nominal from the perspective of the patient
(for example, based on input from patient board members, patient surveys,
advisory committees, or a review of co-pay amount(s) associated with Medicare
and Medicaid for patients with comparable incomes) and would not reflect the
actual cost of the service being provided. [6 ]


c. For services provided directly by the health center (Form 5A: Services Provided, Column

I), the health center’s SFDS(s) is structured consistent with its policy and provides

discounts as follows:


`◦` A full discount is provided for individuals and families with annual incomes at or
below 100 percent of the current FPG, unless a health center elects to have a
nominal charge, which would be less than the fee paid by a patient in the first
sliding fee discount pay class above 100 percent of the FPG.
`◦` Partial discounts are provided for individuals and families with incomes above 100
percent of the current FPG and at or below 200 percent of the current FPG, and


2 A health center’s sliding fee discount program consists of the schedule of discounts that is applied to the fee
schedule and adjusts fees based on the patient’s ability to pay. A health center’s sliding fee discount program also
includes the related policies and procedures for determining sliding fee eligibility and applying sliding fee

discounts.
3 See Chapter 4: Required and Additional Health Services for more information on requirements for services within
the scope of the project.
4 A distinct fee is a fee for a specific service or set of services, which is typically billed for separately within the local

health care market.

5 Income is defined as earnings over a given period of time used to support an individual/household unit based on
a set of criteria of inclusions and exclusions. Income is distinguished from assets, as assets are a fixed economic
resource while income is comprised of earnings.

6 Nominal charges are not “minimum fees,” “minimum charges,” or “co-pays.”


Page | 33


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program_


those discounts adjust based on gradations in income levels and include at least
three discount pay classes. [7 ]

`◦` No discounts are provided to individuals and families with annual incomes above
200 percent of the current FPG. [8 ]


d. For health centers that choose to have more than one SFDS, these SFDSs would be
based on services (for example, having separate SFDSs for broad service types, such as
medical and dental, or distinct subcategories of service types, such as preventive dental
and additional dental services) and/or on service delivery methods (for example, having
separate SFDSs for services provided directly by the health center and for in-scope
services provided via formal written contract) and no other factors.


e. The health center’s SFDS(s) has incorporated the most recent FPG.


f. The health center has operating procedures for assessing/re-assessing all patients for
income and family size consistent with board-approved sliding fee discount program
policies.


g. The health center has records of assessing/re-assessing patient income and family size
except in situations where a patient has declined or refused to provide such

information.


h. The health center has mechanisms for informing patients of the availability of sliding fee
discounts (for example _,_ distributing materials in language(s) and literacy levels
appropriate for the patient population, including information in the intake process,
publishing information on the health center’s website).


i. For in-scope services provided via contracts (Form 5A: Services Provided, Column II,
Formal Written Contract/Agreement), the health center ensures that fees for such

services are discounted as follows:


`◦` A full discount is provided for individuals and families with annual incomes at or
below 100 percent of the current FPG, unless a health center elects to have a
nominal charge, which would be less than the fee paid by a patient in the first
sliding fee discount pay class above 100 percent of the FPG.
`◦` Partial discounts are provided for individuals and families with incomes above 100
percent of the current FPG and at or below 200 percent of the current FPG, and
those discounts adjust based on gradations in income levels and include at least
three discount pay classes.


7 For example, a SFDS with discount pay classes of 101 percent to 125 percent of the FPG, 126 percent to 150
percent of the FPG, 151 percent to 175 percent of the FPG, 176 percent to 200 percent of the FPG, and over 200
percent of the FPG would have four discount pay classes between 101 percent and 200 percent of the FPG.

8 See Chapter 16: Billing and Collections, if the health center has access to other grants or subsidies that support
patient care.


Page | 34


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program_


`◦` No discounts are provided to individuals and families with annual incomes above
200 percent of the current FPG.


j. For services provided via formal referral arrangements (Form 5A: Services Provided,
Column III), the health center ensures that fees for such services are either discounted

as described in element “c.” above or discounted in a manner such that:


`◦` Individuals and families with incomes above 100 percent of the current FPG and
at or below 200 percent of the FPG receive an equal or greater discount for
these services than if the health center’s SFDS were applied to the referral
provider’s fee schedule; and
`◦` Individuals and families at or below 100 percent of the FPG receive a full
discount or a nominal charge for these services.

k. Health center patients who are eligible for sliding fee discounts and have third-party
coverage are charged no more for any out-of-pocket costs than they would have paid
under the applicable SFDS discount pay class. [9 ] Such discounts are subject to potential

legal and contractual restrictions. [10 ]


l. The health center evaluates, at least once every three years, its sliding fee discount
program. At a minimum, the health center:

`◦` Collects utilization data that allows it to assess the rate at which patients within
each of its discount pay classes, as well as those at or below 100 percent of the
FPG, are accessing health center services;
`◦` Utilizes this and, if applicable, other data (for example, results of patient
satisfaction surveys or focus groups, surveys of patients at various income levels)
to evaluate the effectiveness of its sliding fee discount program in reducing
financial barriers to care; and
`◦` Identifies and implements changes as needed.

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


9 For example, an insured patient receives a health center service for which the health center has established a fee
of $80, per its fee schedule. Based on the patient’s insurance plan, the co-pay would be $60 for this service. The
health center also has determined, through an assessment of income and family size, that the patient’s income is
150 percent of the FPG and thus qualifies for the health center’s SFDS. Under the SFDS, a patient with an income at
150 percent of the FPG would receive a 50 percent discount of the $80 fee, resulting in a charge of $40 for this
service. Rather than the $60 co-pay, the health center would charge the patient no more than $40 out-of-pocket,
consistent with its SFDS, as long as this is not precluded or prohibited by the applicable insurance contract.

10 Such limitations may be specified by applicable Federal or state programs, or private payor contracts.


Page | 35


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program_


- The health center determines whether to establish a nominal charge for individuals and
families at or below 100 percent of the FPG.


- The health center determines how to document income and family size in health center

records.

- The health center determines whether to take into consideration the characteristics of its

patient population when developing definitions for income and family size and
procedures for assessing patient eligibility for SFDS. For example, the health center may
consider the availability of income documentation for individuals experiencing
homelessness, build in cost of living considerations when calculating income, permit selfdeclaration of income and family size.

- The health center determines how and with what frequency to re-assess patient eligibility

for the SFDS.

- The health center determines whether to identify individuals who refuse to provide
information on income and family size as ineligible for SFDS .

- The health center determines how to make patients aware of sliding fee discounts (for
example, signage, registration process).

- The health center determines:


`◦` Whether to establish more than three discount pay classes above 100 percent of
the FPG and up to and including 200 percent of the FPG;
`◦` What income range to establish for each discount pay class above 100 percent of
the FPG and up to and including 200 percent of the FPG;
`◦` What method to use for discounting fees above 100 percent of the FPG and up to
and including 200 percent of the FPG (for example, percentage of fee, fixed/flat
fee per discount pay class); and
`◦` Whether to establish multiple SFDSs (for example, separate SFDSs for medical
services and dental services) including, if appropriate, different nominal charges

for each SFDS.

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 10: Quality Improvement/Assurance_


a. The health center has a board-approved policy(ies) that establishes a QI/QA program. [1 ]

This QI/QA program addresses the following:

`◦` The quality and utilization of health center services;
`◦` Patient satisfaction and patient grievance processes; and
`◦` Patient safety, including adverse events.


b. The health center designates an individual(s) to oversee the QI/QA program established
by board-approved policy(ies). This individual’s responsibilities would include, but would
not be limited to, ensuring the implementation of QI/QA operating procedures and
related assessments, monitoring QI/QA outcomes, and updating QI/QA operating
procedures.


c. The health center has operating procedures or processes that address all of the
following:

`◦` Adhering to current evidence-based clinical guidelines, standards of care, and
standards of practice in the provision of health center services, as applicable;
`◦` Identifying, analyzing, and addressing patient safety and adverse events and
implementing follow-up actions, as necessary;
`◦` Assessing patient satisfaction;
`◦` Hearing and resolving patient grievances;
`◦` Completing periodic QI/QA assessments on at least a quarterly basis to inform
the modification of the provision of health center services, as appropriate; and
`◦` Producing and sharing reports on QI/QA to support decision-making and
oversight by key management staff and by the governing board regarding the
provision of health center services.


d. The health center’s physicians or other licensed health care professionals conduct
QI/QA assessments on at least a quarterly basis, using data systematically collected
from patient records, to ensure:

`◦` Provider adherence to current evidence-based clinical guidelines, standards of
care, and standards of practice in the provision of health center services, as
applicable; and
`◦` The identification of any patient safety and adverse events and the
implementation of related follow-up actions, as necessary.

e. The health center maintains a retrievable health record (for example, the health center
has implemented a certified Electronic Health Record (EHR)) [2] for each patient, the


1 See Chapter 19: Board Authority for more information on the health center governing board’s role in approving
policies.

2 CMS and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) have established
standards and other criteria for structured data that Electronic Health Records (EHRs) must use in order to qualify
for CMS incentive programs. For health centers that participate in these CMS Incentive Programs, further

format and content of which is consistent with both Federal and state laws and

requirements.

f. The health center has implemented systems (for example, certified EHRs and
corresponding standard operating procedures) for protecting the confidentiality of
patient information and safeguarding this information against loss, destruction, or
unauthorized use, consistent with Federal and state requirements.

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines whether the position designated with responsibility for
the QI/QA program (for example, Clinical Director, QI Director) is full-time, part-time, or
combined with another position, and whether it is filled by an employee or via contract.

  The health center determines whether the position designated with responsibility for
the QI/QA program is filled by a physician, other licensed health care professional (for
example, registered nurse, nurse practitioner), or other qualified individual (for
example, an individual with a Master of Public Health or a Master of Healthcare
Administration).

  The health center determines which QI/QA methodology(ies) to use.


  The health center determines the type of patient health record system that it will use.

  The health center determines the format, content, and focus of QI/QA reports.

_**Requirements**_


  - The health center must have position descriptions for key personnel [also referred to as
key management staff] that set forth training and experience qualifications necessary to
carry out the activities of the health center.

  - The health center must maintain sufficient key personnel [also referred to as key
management staff] to carry out the activities of the health center.

  - The health center must request prior approval from HRSA for a change in the key person
specified in the Health Center Program award or Health Center Program look-alike
designation.

  The health center must directly employ its Project Director/CEO. [1 ]


_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following**_ **:**


a. The health center has determined the makeup of and distribution of functions among its
key management staff [2] and the percentage of time dedicated to the Health Center
Program project for each position, as necessary to carry out the HRSA-approved scope
of project.


1 While the position title of the key person who is specified in the award/designation may vary, for the purposes of
the Health Center Program, this Chapter will utilize the term “Project Director/CEO” when referring to this key
person. Under 45 CFR 75.2, the term “Principal Investigator/Program Director (PI/PD)” means the individual(s)
designated by the recipient to direct the project or program being supported by the grant. The PI/PD is responsible
and accountable to officials of the recipient organization for the proper conduct of the project, program, or
activity. For the purposes of the Health Center Program, “Project Director/CEO” is synonymous with the term
“PI/PD.”

2 Examples of key management staff may include Project Director/CEO, Clinical Director/Chief Medical Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Nursing/Health Services Director, or Chief Information Officer.


Page | 40


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 11: Key Management Staff_


b. The health center has documented the training and experience qualifications, as well as
the duties or functions, for each key management staff position (for example, in position
descriptions).

c. The health center has implemented, as necessary, a process for filling vacant key
management staff positions (for example, vacancy announcements have been published
and reflect the identified qualifications).

d. The health center’s Project Director/CEO is directly employed by the health center, [3]
reports to the health center’s governing board [4] and is responsible for overseeing other
key management staff in carrying out the day-to-day activities necessary to fulfill the
HRSA-approved scope of project.


e. If there has been a post-award change in the Project Director/CEO position, [5] the health
center requests and receives prior approval from HRSA.


_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center’s governing board determines when a less than full time Project
Director/CEO position is sufficient to oversee the day-to-day activities of the HRSAapproved scope of project.

  - The health center determines when and if it is appropriate and necessary to contract for
key management staff positions (other than the CEO, who may not be a contractor),
rather than directly employ such individuals.

  - The health center determines key management staff position titles (for example,
utilizing the title “CEO” or “Project Director”) and how functions are distributed among
its key management staff positions (for example, determining in a smaller health center
whether it is appropriate to combine the CEO and CFO functions).


3 Public agency health centers utilizing a co-applicant structure would demonstrate compliance with the statutory
requirement for direct employment of the Project Director/CEO by demonstrating that the public agency, as the
Health Center Program awardee/designee of record, directly employs the Project Director/CEO. Refer to related
requirements in Chapter 19: Board Authority regarding public agencies with co-applicants.
4 Refer to related requirements in Chapter 19: Board Authority regarding the selection and dismissal of the Project
Director/CEO by the health center board as part of its oversight responsibilities for the Health Center Program
project.

5 Such changes include situations in which the current Project Director/CEO will be disengaged from involvement in
the Health Center Program project for any continuous period for more than 3 months or will reduce time devoted
to the project by 25 percent or more from the level that was approved at the time of award [see: 45 CFR
75.308(c)(1)(ii) and (iii)].

_Section 1905(l)(2)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act_

_**Requirements**_

**Contracts: Procurement and Monitoring** _**[1]**_


  - The health center must determine [2] whether an individual agreement that will result in
disbursement of Federal funds will be carried out through a contract or a subaward and
structure the agreement accordingly. [3 ]


  - The health center must request and receive approval from HRSA to contract for

[substantive programmatic] work [4] under its Health Center Program award.


  - The health center must use its own documented procurement procedures which reflect
applicable State, local, and tribal laws and regulations, provided that for procurement
actions paid for in whole or in part under the Federal award, the procurements conform

with 45 CFR Part 75.


1 All procurement standards included in 45 CFR Part 75 apply for procurement actions paid for in whole or in part
under the Federal award. These standards do not relieve the non-Federal entity of any contractual responsibilities
under its contracts. HRSA will not substitute its judgment for that of the non-Federal entity unless the matter is
primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, tribal, state, or Federal authority having
proper jurisdiction.

2 Per 45 CFR 75.351(c): “In determining whether an agreement between a pass through entity [Health Center
Program awardee] and another non-Federal entity casts the latter as a subrecipient or a contractor, the substance
of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. All of the characteristics listed above [see
45 CFR 75.351(a) and (b)] may not be present in all cases, and the pass-through entity [Health Center Program
awardee] must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract.”
3 Specifically, the purpose of a subaward is to carry out a portion of the Federal award and creates a Federal
assistance relationship with the subrecipient, while the purpose of a contract is to obtain goods or services for the
health center‘s own use and creates a procurement relationship with the contractor.

4 For the purposes of the Health Center Program, contracting for substantive programmatic work applies to
contracting with a single entity for the majority of health care providers. The acquisition of supplies, material,
equipment, or general support services is not considered programmatic work. Substantive programmatic work
may be further defined within HRSA Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) and applications.


Page | 42


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 12: Contracts and Subawards_


  - The health center must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every
procurement action paid for in whole or in part by the Federal award in excess of the
Simplified Acquisition Threshold. [5 ]


  - The health center must conduct all procurement transactions paid for in whole or in
part by the Federal award, in a manner that provides full and open competition
consistent with the standards of 45 CFR 75.328. Procurements by non-competitive
proposals [6] are allowable only when:

`◦` The item is available only from a single source;
`◦` The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay
resulting from competitive solicitation;
`◦` The non-competitive proposal is specifically authorized by HRSA (or, in the case
of a subrecipient, the Federal award recipient) in response to a written request
from the Federal award recipient or subrecipient; or
`◦` Competition is determined to be inadequate after soliciting a number of sources.

  - Health center contracts with other providers for the provision of health services within
the HRSA-approved scope of project must include a schedule of rates and method of
payment for such services.

  - The health center must oversee contractors to ensure their performance is in
accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts and to
assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements. [7 ]


  - The health center must retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical
records, and all other records pertinent to the Health Center Program award carried out
under contracts for a period of three years from the date of the submission of the final
expenditures report to HHS.


5 _Simplified acquisition threshold_ means the dollar amount below which a non-Federal entity may purchase
property or services using small purchase methods. Non-Federal entities adopt small purchase procedures in order
to expedite the purchase of items costing less than the simplified acquisition threshold. The simplified acquisition
threshold is set by the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR subpart 2.1 and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1908.
The acquisition threshold is periodically adjusted for inflation.

6 As defined by 45 CFR 75.329(f), procurement by “noncompetitive proposals” is procurement through solicitation
of a proposal from only one source.

7 The health center is responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment,
for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements paid for in whole or in
part under the Federal award. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes,

and claims.

**Subawards: Monitoring and Management**


  - The Health Center Program awardee must determine whether an individual agreement
that will result in disbursement of Federal funds will be carried out through a contract or
a subaward and structure the agreement accordingly. [8] With respect to subawards:

`◦` The health center awardee must make documented, case-by-case
determinations whether the agreement it makes for the disbursement of Federal
program funds casts the party receiving the funds in the role of a subrecipient,
consistent with the characteristics outlined in 45 CFR 75.351; [ 9 ]

`◦` The health center awardee must identify subawards as such to the subrecipient,
and provide all applicable information to the subrecipient as described in 45 CFR
75.352(a)(1), including the total amount of the Federal Award committed to the
subrecipient by the health center awardee;
`◦` If any of the data elements contained in 45 CFR 75.352(a)(1) change, the health
center awardee must include the change(s) in a subsequent subaward

modification.


  - The Health Center Program awardee must request and receive approval from HRSA to

make a subaward under the Federal award.

  - The Health Center Program awardee must ensure that, at the time of making a
subaward, each subrecipient, which is a subawardee of Federal funds, complies with all
applicable requirements specified in the Federal award (including those found in section
330 of the PHS Act, implementing program regulations, and grants regulations in 45 CFR
Part 75).

  - The Health Center Program awardee must monitor the ongoing activities of the
subrecipient to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized purposes and that the
subrecipient maintains compliance with all applicable requirements specified in the
Federal award (including those found in section 330 of the PHS Act, implementing
program regulations, and grants regulations in 45 CFR Part 75).

  - The Health Center Program awardee must retain financial records, supporting
documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the Health Center
Program award as carried out under any subawards for a period of three years from the
date of the submission of the final expenditures report to the health center awardee.


8 Specifically, the purpose of a subaward is to carry out a portion of the Federal award and create a Federal
assistance relationship with the subrecipient, while the purpose of a contract is to obtain goods or services for the
health center’s own use and creates a procurement relationship with the contractor.

9 Per 45 CFR 75.351(c): “In determining whether an agreement between a pass through entity [Health Center
Program awardee] and another non-Federal entity casts the latter as a subrecipient or a contractor, the substance
of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. All of the characteristics listed above [see
45 CFR 75.351(a) and (b)] may not be present in all cases, and the pass-through entity [Health Center Program
awardee] must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract.”

_Chapter 12: Contracts and Subawards_


  - The Health Center Program awardee must consider whether the results of the
subrecipient's audits, on-site reviews, or other monitoring indicate conditions that
necessitate adjustments to the Health Center Program awardee's own records and
whether the Health Center Program awardee must consider taking enforcement action
against noncompliant subrecipients as described in 45 CFR 75.371.


_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following:**_

**Contracts: Procurement and Monitoring**


a. The health center has written procurement procedures that comply with Federal
procurement standards, including a process for ensuring that all procurement costs
directly attributable to the Federal award are allowable, consistent with Federal Cost
Principles. [10 ]


b. The health center has records for procurement actions paid for in whole or in part under
the Federal award that include the rationale for method of procurement, selection of
contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price. This
would include documentation related to noncompetitive procurements.

c. The health center retains final contracts and related procurement records, consistent
with Federal document maintenance requirements, for procurement actions paid for in
whole or in part under the Federal award. [11 ]


d. The health center has access to contractor records and reports related to health center
activities in order to ensure that all activities and reporting requirements are being
carried out in accordance with the provisions and timelines of the related contract (for
example, performance goals are achieved, Uniform Data System (UDS) data are
submitted by appropriate deadlines, funds are used for authorized purposes).

e. If the health center has arrangements with a contractor to perform substantive
programmatic work, [12] the health center requested and received prior approval from
HRSA as documented by:


10 See 45 CFR 75 Subpart E: Cost Principles.

11 See 45 CFR 75.361 for HHS retention requirements for records.

12 For the purposes of the Health Center Program, contracting for substantive programmatic work applies to
contracting with a single entity for the majority of health care providers. The acquisition of supplies, material,

subrecipient of the health center from participating in the selection, award, or administration of that subaward.
This also includes prohibiting board members who are employees of an organization that contracts with the health
center from participating in the selection, award, or administration of that contract.

4 Health centers may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an
unsolicited item of nominal value. See _Related Considerations_ in this chapter _._

5 Organizational conflicts of interest mean that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or
subsidiary organization, the health center is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a
procurement action involving a related organization. See: 45 CFR 75.327(c)(2).

participate in the selection, award, or administration of that contract).

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines the appropriate methods for employees, officers, board
members, and agents to disclose real or apparent conflicts of interest, as it applies to
the procurement process.

  - The health center determines how to inform its employees, officers, board members,
and agents about the health center’s standards of conduct (for example, inclusion
within operating procedures or staff manuals, as part of disclosure forms/statements,
employee and board orientations or trainings).

  - The health center determines whether to establish additional standards of conduct that


are not addressed by Federal requirements.

  - The health center determines whether to set standards that define when a financial


interest is not substantial or a gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value and, therefore,
could be accepted by employees, officers, board members, and agents of the health

center.

_**Requirements**_


  The health center has made and must continue to make every reasonable effort to
establish and maintain collaborative relationships, including with other health care
providers that provide care within the catchment area [service area], local hospitals, and
specialty providers in the catchment area of the center, to provide access to services not
available through the health center and to reduce the non-urgent use of hospital
emergency departments.

  To the extent possible, the health center must coordinate and integrate project
activities with the activities of other federally-funded, as well as State and local, health
services delivery projects and programs serving the same population.

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following:**_


a. The health center documents its efforts to collaborate with other providers or programs
in the service area, including local hospitals, specialty providers, and social service
organizations (including those that serve special populations), to provide access to
services not available through the health center in order to support:

`◦` Reductions in the non-urgent use of hospital emergency departments;
`◦` Continuity of care across community providers; and
`◦` Access to other health or community services that impact the patient
population.

b. The health center documents its efforts to coordinate and integrate activities with other
federally-funded, as well as State and local, health services delivery projects and
programs serving similar patient populations in the service area (at a minimum, this
would include establishing and maintaining relationships with other health centers in
the service area).

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 14: Collaborative Relationships_


c. If the health center expands [1,2] its HRSA-approved scope of project:

`◦` The health center obtains letters or other appropriate documents specific to the
request or application that describe areas of coordination or collaboration with
health care providers serving similar patient populations in the service area
(health centers, rural health clinics, local hospitals including critical access
hospitals, health departments, other providers including specialty providers, as
applicable); or
`◦` If such letters or documents cannot be obtained from these providers, the health
center documents its attempts to coordinate or collaborate with these health
care providers (health centers, rural health clinics, local hospitals including
critical access hospitals, health departments, other providers including specialty
providers, as applicable) on the specific request or application proposal.


_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines how to document collaboration or coordination with

providers and organizations in its service area (for example, through a memorandum of
agreement, letters, membership on a city-wide community health planning council).


1 Expanding the HRSA-approved scope of project may occur by adding sites or services through change-in-scope
requests, New Access Point competitive applications, or other supplemental funding applications.
2 Additional requirements for documented collaboration may apply based on specific Notices of Funding
Opportunity (NOFOs), Notices of Award (NoAs), look-alike designation instructions, or other Federal statutes,
regulations, or policies.

regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

  - The health center must develop and utilize financial management and control systems
in accordance with sound financial management procedures which ensure at a

minimum:


`◦` The fiscal integrity of grant financial transactions and reports; and
`◦` Ongoing compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and
conditions of the Health Center Program award or designation.

  - The health center’s financial management system must specifically identify in its
accounts all Federal awards, including the Federal award made under the Health Center
Program, received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were
received (see 45 CFR 75.302). This financial management system must also provide for
all of the following:

Federal award or program in accordance with the reporting requirements (see
45 CFR 75.341 and 75.342);
`◦` Records that identify the source (receipt) and application (expenditure) of funds
for federally-funded activities. These records must contain information
pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, expenditures, income, and interest, and be supported by source
documentation (see: 45 CFR 75.302(b)(3));
`◦` Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of
Federal award funds from HHS and the disbursement of these funds by the
health center (see 45 CFR 75.305);

_Chapter 15: Financial Management and Accounting Systems_


`◦` Written procedures for assuring that expenditures of Federal award funds are

allowable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award and

with the Federal Cost Principles (see 45 CFR Part 75 Subpart E).

  A health center that expends $750,000 or more in Federal awards during its fiscal year
must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with
the provisions of 45 CFR Part 75 Subpart F.

  - The health center must use any non-grant funds as permitted under section 330, and
may use such funds for such other purposes as are not specifically prohibited under
section 330, if such use furthers the objectives of the [health center] project.

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following:**_


a. The health center has and utilizes a financial management and internal control system
that reflects Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for private non-profit
health centers or Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) principles for public
agency health centers [1] and that ensures at a minimum:

`◦` Health center expenditures are consistent with the HRSA-approved total budget [2]
and with any additional applicable HRSA approvals that have been requested
and received; [3 ]

`◦` Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other
assets associated with the Health Center Program project;
`◦` The safeguarding of all assets to assure they are used solely for authorized
purposes in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Health Center
Program award/designation; [4 ] and

`◦` The capacity to track the financial performance of the health center, including


1 GAAP and GASB are used as defined in 45 CFR Part 75.

2 A health center’s “total budget” includes the Health Center Program Federal award funds and all other sources of
revenue in support of the HRSA-approved Health Center Program scope of project. For additional detail, see
Chapter 17: Budget.
3 Per 45 CFR 75.308, post-award, Federal award recipients are required to report significant deviations from
budget or project scope or objective, and are required to request prior approvals from HHS awarding agencies for
budget and program plan revisions (re-budgeting). “Re-budgeting, or moving funds between direct cost budget
categories in an approved budget, is considered significant when cumulative transfers for a single budget period
exceeds 25 percent of the total approved budget (inclusive of direct and indirect costs and Federal funds and
required matching or cost sharing). The base used for determining significant re-budgeting excludes carryover
balances but includes any amounts awarded as supplements.”

4 The requirement to safeguard federal assets as described in this bullet substantially reflects the requirement to
have written policies and procedures in place to ensure the appropriate use of Federal funds in compliance with
applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See Section
330(k)(3)(N) of the Public Health Service Act.

identification of trends or conditions that may warrant action by the
organization to maintain financial stability.

b. The health center’s financial management system is able to account for all Federal
award(s) (including the Federal award made under the Health Center Program) in order
to identify the source [5] (receipt) and application (expenditure) of funds for federallyfunded activities in whole or in part. Specifically, the health center’s financial records

contain information and related source documentation pertaining to authorizations,
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, expenditures, income, and interest under the
Federal award(s).

c. The health center has written procedures for:

`◦` Drawing down Federal award funds in a manner that minimizes the time elapsing

between the transfer of the Federal award funds from HRSA and the

disbursement of these funds by the health center; and
`◦` Assuring that expenditures of Federal award funds are allowable in accordance

with the terms and conditions of the Federal award and with the Federal Cost
Principles [6] in 45 CFR Part 75 Subpart E.


d. If a health center expends **$750,000 or more in award funds from all Federal sources**
during its fiscal year, the health center ensures a single or program-specific audit is
conducted and submitted for that year in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR Part
75, Subpart F: Audit Requirements and ensures that subsequent audits demonstrate
corrective actions have been taken to address all findings, questioned costs, reportable
conditions, and material weaknesses cited in the previous audit report, if applicable.


e. The health center can document that any non-grant funds generated from Health
Center Program project activities, in excess of what is necessary to support the HRSAapproved total Health Center Program project budget, were utilized to further the
objectives of the project by benefiting the current or proposed patient population and
were not utilized for purposes that are specifically prohibited by the Health Center

Program.

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following:**_


a. The health center has a fee schedule for services that are within the HRSA-approved

scope of project and are typically billed for in the local health care market.


b. The health center uses data on locally prevailing rates and actual health center costs to
develop and update its fee schedule.


c. The health center participates in Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, and, as appropriate, other
public or private assistance programs or health insurance.

d. The health center has systems, which may include operating procedures, for billing and

collections that address:

`◦` Educating patients on insurance and, if applicable, related third-party coverage
options available to them;
`◦` Billing Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and other public and private assistance programs
or insurance in a timely manner, as applicable; [1 ] and

`◦` Requesting applicable payments from patients, while ensuring that no patient is
denied service based on inability to pay.

e. If a health center elects to offer additional billing options or payment methods (for
example, payment plans, grace periods, prompt or cash payment incentives), the health
center has operating procedures for implementing these options or methods and for
ensuring they are accessible to all patients regardless of income level or sliding fee
discount pay class.

f. The health center has billing records that show claims are submitted in a timely and
accurate manner to the third party payor sources with which it participates (Medicaid,
CHIP, Medicare, and other public and private insurance) in order to collect
reimbursement for its costs in providing health services [2] consistent with the terms of
such contracts and other arrangements.


g. The health center has billing records or other forms of documentation that reflect that

_Chapter 16: Billing and Collections_


`◦` Charges patients in accordance with its fee schedule and, if applicable, the
sliding fee discount schedule; [3 ] and

`◦` Makes reasonable efforts to collect such amounts owed from patients.


h. The health center has and utilizes board-approved policies, as well as operating
procedures, that include the specific circumstances when the health center will waive or
reduce fees or payments required by the center due to any patient’s inability to pay.

i. If a health center provides supplies or equipment that are related to, but not included
in, the service itself as part of prevailing standards of care [4] (for example, eyeglasses,
prescription drugs, dentures) and charges patients for these items, the health center
informs patients of such charges (“out-of-pocket costs”) prior to the time of service. [5 ]


j. If a health center elects to limit or deny services based on a patient’s refusal to pay, the
health center has a board-approved policy that distinguishes between refusal to pay and
inability to pay and notifies patients of:

`◦` Amounts owed and the time permitted to make such payments;
`◦` Collection efforts that will be taken when these situations occur (for example,
meeting with a financial counselor, establishing payment plans); and
`◦` How services will be limited or denied when it is determined that the patient has
refused to pay.

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines how to consider both locally prevailing charges and actual
costs for services when setting the fee schedule, as well as the data used to determine
locally prevailing charges (for example, Medicare, Medicaid, private providers, or
commercial sources).

  - The health center determines whether to charge a single fee for related health center
services, medically-related supplies, and/or equipment. Examples include, but are not
limited to, charging a single fee for a well-child visit and the immunizations provided
during that visit or combining all prenatal care visits and labs into a single fee.


3 See Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program for more information on the sliding fee discount schedule.

4 These items differ from supplies and equipment that are included in a service as part of prevailing standards of
care and are reflected in the fee schedule (e.g., casting materials, bandages).

  - The health center determines whether to participate in a specific insurance plan based
on its patient population and the costs and benefits of such participation.

  - If a health center has a funding source that subsidizes or covers all or part of the fees for
certain services for specific patients (in accordance with the terms and conditions of
such funding sources), the health center may use such funding sources to support
discounts greater than those available through the health center’s sliding fee discount
program. [6 ]


  - If a health center elects to provide its patients access to supplies or equipment (for
example, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dentures) that are related to, but not included
in, the service itself as part of prevailing standards of care, the health center determines
how to charge its patients for such supplies or equipment (for example, flat discounts, at
cost, sliding fee discounts).

  - If a health center limits or denies services to patients based on refusal to pay, the health
center determines how and when such patients may be permitted to rejoin the practice.

termination/dismissal of the health center’s Project Director/Chief Executive Officer
(CEO).


  - The health center governing board must have authority for establishing or adopting
policies for the conduct of the Health Center Program project and for updating these
policies when needed. Specifically, the health center governing board must have

Act.

2 For public agencies that elect to have a co-applicant, these authorities and functions apply to the co-applicant

board.

3 Where geography or other circumstances make monthly, in-person participation in board meetings burdensome,
monthly meetings may be conducted by telephone or other means of electronic communication where all parties
can both listen and speak to all other parties.
4 Boards of organizations receiving a Health Center Program award/designation only under section 330(g) may
meet less than once a month during periods of the year, as specified in the bylaws, where monthly meetings are
not practical due to health center patient migration out of the area. 42 CFR 56.304(d)(2).

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 19: Board Authority_


  - The health center governing board must ensure that a process is developed for hearing
and resolving patient grievances.

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following**_ :


a. The health center’s organizational structure, articles of incorporation, bylaws, and other
relevant documents ensure the health center governing board maintains the authority
for oversight of the Health Center Program project, specifically:

`◦` The organizational structure and documents do not allow for any other
individual, entity or committee (including, but not limited to, an executive
committee authorized by the board) to reserve approval authority or have veto
power over the health center board with regard to the required authorities and
functions; [11 ]

`◦` In cases where a health center collaborates with other entities in fulfilling the
health center’s HRSA-approved scope of project, such collaboration or
agreements with the other entities do not restrict or infringe upon the health
center board’s required authorities and functions; and
`◦` For public agencies with a co-applicant board; [12] the health center has a co
applicant agreement that delegates the required authorities and functions to the
co-applicant board and delineates the roles and responsibilities of the public
agency and the co-applicant in carrying out the Health Center Program project.


b. The health center’s articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other relevant documents
outline the following required authorities and responsibilities of the governing board:

`◦` Holding monthly meetings;
`◦` Approving the selection (and termination or dismissal, as appropriate) of the
health center’s Project Director/CEO;
`◦` Approving the annual Health Center Program project budget and applications;
`◦` Approving health center services and the location and hours of operation of
health center sites;
`◦` Evaluating the performance of the health center;


11 This does not preclude an executive committee from taking actions on behalf of the board in emergencies, on
which the full board will subsequently vote.

12 Public agencies are permitted to utilize a co-applicant governance structure for the purposes of meeting Health
Center Program governance requirements. Public centers may be structured in one of two ways to meet the
program requirements: 1) the public agency independently meets all the Health Center Program governance
requirements based on the existing structure and vested authorities of the public agency’s governing board; or 2)
together, the public agency and the co-applicant meet all Health Center Program requirements.


Page | 68


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 19: Board Authority_


`◦` Establishing or adopting policy [13] related to the operations of the health center;

and


`◦` Assuring the health center operates in compliance with applicable Federal, State,
and local laws and regulations.


c. The health center’s board minutes and other relevant documents confirm that the

board exercises, without restriction, the following authorities and functions:

`◦` Holding monthly meetings where a quorum is present to ensure the board has
the ability to exercise its required authorities and functions;
`◦` Approving the selection, evaluation and, if necessary, the dismissal or
termination of the Project Director/CEO from the Health Center Program project;
`◦` Approving applications related to the Health Center Program project, including
approving the annual budget, which outlines the proposed uses of both Health
Center Program award and non-Federal resources and revenue;
`◦` Approving the Health Center Program project’s sites, hours of operation and
services, including decisions to subaward or contract for a substantial portion of
the health center’s services;
`◦` Monitoring the financial status of the health center, including reviewing the
results of the annual audit, and ensuring appropriate follow-up actions are
taken;
`◦` Conducting long-range/strategic planning at least once every three years, which
at a minimum addresses financial management and capital expenditure needs;

and

`◦` Evaluating the performance of the health center based on quality
assurance/quality improvement assessments and other information received
from health center management, [14] and ensuring appropriate follow-up actions
are taken regarding:

        - Achievement of project objectives;

        - Service utilization patterns;

        - Quality of care;

        - Efficiency and effectiveness of the center; and

        - Patient satisfaction, including addressing any patient grievances.


13 The governing board of a health center is generally responsible for establishing and/or approving policies that
govern health center operations, while the health center’s staff is generally responsible for implementing and
ensuring adherence to these policies (including through operating procedures).

14 For more information related to the production of reports associated with these topics, see Chapter 18: Program
Monitoring and Data Reporting Systems, Chapter 15: Financial Management and Accounting Systems, and Chapter
10: Quality Improvement/Assurance.

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 19: Board Authority_


d. The health center board has adopted, evaluated at least once every three years, and, as
needed, approved updates to policies in the following areas: Sliding Fee Discount
Program, Quality Improvement/Assurance, and Billing and Collections. [15 ]


e. The health center board has adopted, evaluated at least once every three years, and, as
needed, approved updates to policies that support financial management and
accounting systems and personnel policies. However, in cases where a public agency is
the recipient of the Health Center Program Federal award or designation and has
established a co-applicant structure, the public agency may establish and retain the
authority to adopt and approve policies that support financial management and
accounting systems and personnel policies.

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center board determines how to carry out required responsibilities,
functions, and authorities in areas such as the following:

`◦` Whether to establish standing committees, including the number and type of
such committees (for example, executive, finance, quality improvement,
personnel, planning).
`◦` Whether to seek input or assistance from other organizations or subject matter
experts (for example, joint committees for health centers that collaborate closely
with other organizations, consultants, community leaders).
`◦` How often the Project Director/CEO performance is evaluated.

  - The health center determines how to set quorum for board meetings consistent with
state, territorial or other applicable law.

  The health center board determines the format of its long-range/strategic planning.


  - For public agencies with co-applicant boards, the co-applicant board and the public
agency determine how to collaborate in carrying out the Health Center Program project
(for example, shared project assessment, public agency participation on board
committees, joint preparation of grant applications).


15 Policies related to billing and collections that require board approval include those that address the waiving or
reducing of amounts owed by patients due to inability to pay, and if applicable those that limit or deny services
due to refusal to pay.

_**Authority**_

_Section 330(k)(3)(H) of the PHS Act; and 42 CFR 51c.304 and 42 CFR 56.304_

_**Requirements**_ _**[1,2 ]**_


  - The health center’s governing board must consist of at least 9 and no more than 25
members. [3 ]


  - The majority [at least 51 percent] of the health center board members must be
patients [4] served by the health center. These health center patient board members

must, as a group, represent the individuals who are served by the health center in terms
of demographic factors, such as race, ethnicity, and sex.

  - Non-patient health center board members must be representative of the community
served by the health center and must be selected for their expertise in relevant subject
areas, such as community affairs, local government, finance and banking, legal affairs,
trade unions, and other commercial and industrial concerns, or social service agencies
within the community.


  - Of the non-patient health center board members, no more than one-half may derive
more than 10 percent of their annual income from the health care industry. [5 ]


  - A health center board member may not be an employee of the center, or spouse or
child, parent, brother or sister by blood or marriage of such an employee. [6 ] The project


1 The governing board of a health center operated by Indian tribes, tribal groups, or Indian organizations under the
Indian Self-Determination Act or Urban Indian Organizations under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is
exempt from the specific board composition requirements discussed in this document. Section 330(k)(3)(H) of the

PHS Act.
2 For public agencies that elect to have a co-applicant, these board composition requirements apply to the coapplicant board.

3 42 CFR 51c.304(a) and 42 CFR 56.304(a) permit that the requirement regarding board size may be waived by the
Secretary for good cause shown. HRSA will not grant such waivers except where the health center has
demonstrated to HRSA an inability to meet the requirement.

4 Patient board members are also often referred to as “user” or “consumer” board members. However, for the
purposes of this chapter, only the term “patient” or “non-patient” board member will be used for ease of

reference.

5 Per the regulations in 42 CFR 56.304, for health centers awarded/designated solely under section 330(g) of the
PHS Act, no more than _two-thirds_ of the non-patient board members may derive more than 10 percent of their
annual income from the health care industry.

6 While no board member may be an employee of the health center, 42 CFR 51c.107 permits the health center to
use Federal award funds to reimburse board members for these limited purposes: 1) reasonable expenses actually

director [Chief Executive Officer (CEO)] may be a non-voting, ex-officio member of the

board.

  - The health center bylaws or other internal governing rules must prescribe the process
for selection and removal of all governing board members. This selection process must
ensure that the governing board is representative of the health center patient
population. The selection process in the bylaws or other rules is subject to approval by

HRSA.

  - In cases where a health center receives an award/designation under section 330(g),

330(h) and/or 330(i) and does not receive an award/designation under section 330(e), the
health center may request approval from HRSA for a waiver of the patient majority board
composition governance requirement by showing good cause.

_**Demonstrating Compliance**_

_**A health center would demonstrate compliance with these requirements by fulfilling all of the**_
_**following**_ :


a. The health center has bylaws or other relevant documents that specify the process for
ongoing selection and removal of board members. This board member selection and
removal process does not permit any other entity, committee or individual (other than
the board) to select either the board chair or the majority of health center board
members, [7] including a majority of the non-patient board members. [8 ]


b. The health center has bylaws or other relevant documents that require the board to be
composed as follows:

`◦` Board size is at least 9 and no more than 25 members, [9] with either a specific
number or a range of board members prescribed;


incurred by reason of their participation in board activities (e.g., transportation to board meetings, childcare during
board meetings); or 2) wages lost by reason of participation in the activities of such board members if the member
is from a family with an annual family income less than $10,000 or if the member is a single person with an annual
income less than $7,000. For section 330(g)-only awarded/designated health centers, 42 CFR 56.108 permits the
use of grant funds for certain limited reimbursement of board members as follows: 1) for reasonable expenses
actually incurred by reason of their participation in board activities (e.g., transportation to board meetings,
childcare during board meetings); 2) for wages lost by reason of participation in the activities of such board
members. Health centers may wish to consult with their legal counsel and auditor on applicable state law
regarding reimbursement restrictions for non-profit board members and implications for IRS tax-exempt status.

7 An outside entity may only remove a board member who has been selected by that entity as an organizational
representative to the governing board.
8 For example, if the health center has an agreement with another organization, the agreement does not permit
that organization to select either the chair or a majority of the health center board.

9 For the purposes of the Health Center Program, the term “board member” refers only to voting members of the

board.


Page | 72


_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 20: Board Composition_


`◦` At least 51 percent of board members are patients served by the health center.
For the purposes of board composition, a patient is an individual who has
received at least one service in the past 24 months that generated a health
center visit, where both the service and the site where the service was received
are within the HRSA-approved scope of project;
`◦` Patient members of the board, as a group, represent the individuals who are
served by the health center in terms of demographic factors, such as race,
ethnicity, and sex;
`◦` Non-patient members are representative of the community served by the health
center or the health center’s service area;
`◦` Non-patient members are selected to provide relevant expertise and skills such

as:


        - Community affairs;

        - Local government;

        - Finance and banking;

        - Legal affairs;

        - Trade unions and other commercial and industrial concerns; and

        - Social services;
`◦` No more than one-half of non-patient board members derive more than 10
percent of their annual income from the health care industry; and
`◦` Health center employees, [10,11] and immediate family members (i.e., spouses,
children, parents, or siblings through blood, adoption, or marriage) of employees
may not be health center board members.


c. The health center has documentation that the board is composed of:

`◦` At least 9 and no more than 25 members;
`◦` A patient [12] majority (at least 51 percent);

`◦` Patient board members, as a group, represent the individuals who are served by
the health center in terms of demographic factors, such as race, ethnicity, and
sex, consistent with the demographics reported in the health center’s Uniform
Data System (UDS) report; [13 ]


10 For the purposes of health center board composition, an employee of the health center would include an
individual who would be considered a “common-law employee” or “statutory employee” according to the Internal
Revenue Service criteria, as well as an individual who would be considered an employee for state or local law

purposes.
11 In the case of public agencies with co-applicant boards, this includes employees or immediate family members of
both the co-applicant organization and the public agency component (for example, department, division, or subagency) in which the Health Center Program project is located.

12 A legal guardian of a patient who is a dependent child or adult, a person who has legal authority to make health
care decisions on behalf of a patient, or a legal sponsor of an individual under 8 U.S.C. 1138a may also be
considered a patient of the health center for purposes of board representation. Students who are health center
patients may participate as board members subject to state laws applicable to such non-profit board members.

13 For health centers that have not yet made a Uniform Data System (UDS) report, this would be assessed based on
demographic data included in the health center’s application.

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 20: Board Composition_


`◦` Representative(s) from or for each of the special population(s) [14] for those health

centers that receive any award/designation under one or more of the special
populations section 330 subparts, 330(g), (h), and/or (i); and

`◦` As applicable, non-patient board members:

        - Who are representative of the community in which the health center is
located, either by living or working in the community, or by having a
demonstrable connection to the community;

        - With relevant skills and expertise in areas such as community affairs,
local government, finance and banking, legal affairs, trade unions, other
commercial and industrial concerns, or social services within the
community; and

        - Of whom no more than 50 percent earn more than 10 percent of their
annual income from the health care industry. [15 ]


d. The health center verifies periodically (for example, annually or during the selection or
renewal of board member terms) that the governing board does not include members
who are current employees of the health center, or immediate family members of
current health center employees (i.e., spouses, children, parents, or siblings through
blood, adoption, or marriage).


e. In cases where a health center receives an award/designation under section 330(g),

330(h) and/or 330(i), does not receive an award/designation under section 330(e), and
requests a waiver of the patient majority board composition requirements, the health
center presents to HRSA for review and approval:

`◦` “Good cause” that justifies the need for the waiver by documenting:

        - The unique characteristics of the population (homeless, migratory or

seasonal agricultural worker, and/or public housing patient population)
or service area that create an undue hardship in recruiting a patient
majority; and

        - Its attempt(s) to recruit a majority of special population board members
within the past three years; and
`◦` Strategies that will ensure patient participation and input in the direction and
ongoing governance of the organization by addressing the following elements:

        - Collection and documentation of input from the special population(s);

        - Communication of special population input directly to the health center
governing board; and


14 Representation could include advocates for the health center’s section 330 (g), (h), or (i) patient population (for
example, those who have personally experienced being a member of, have expertise about, or work closely with
the current special population). Such advocate board members would count as “patient” board members only if
they meet the patient definition set forth in this chapter.

15 For example, in a 9 member board with 5 patient board members, there could be 4 non-patient board members.
In this case, no more than 2 non-patient board members could earn more than 10 percent of their income from
the health care industry.

_Health Center Program Compliance Manual_
_Chapter 20: Board Composition_


        - Incorporation of special population input into key areas, including but not
limited to: selecting health center services; [ 16] setting hours of operation of
health center sites; [17] defining budget priorities; [18] evaluating the
organization’s progress in meeting goals, including patient satisfaction; [19]
and assessing the effectiveness of the sliding fee discount program. [20 ]


f. For health centers with approved waivers, the health center has board minutes or other
documentation that demonstrates how special population patient input is utilized in
making governing board decisions in key areas, including but not limited to: selecting
health center services; setting hours of operation of health center sites; defining budget
priorities; evaluating the organization’s progress in meeting goals, including patient
satisfaction; and assessing the effectiveness of the sliding fee discount program.

_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - Within the range of 9 to 25 board members, the health center determines the
appropriate board size for its organization.

  - In addition to race, ethnicity, and sex, the health center determines other relevant
demographic or geographic factors to consider when selecting patient or non-patient

board members.

  - In cases where language or literacy may present a barrier to board members’ evaluation
of written materials, the health center determines how to make accommodations to
ensure the meaningful participation of such board members.


  - The health center board determines whether to include non-voting, ex-officio members
including, for example, the Project Director/CEO, other health center staff members, or
community members on the board, consistent with what is permitted under other
applicable laws.


16 See Chapter 4: Required and Additional Health Services for more information on providing services within the
HRSA-approved scope of project.
17 See Chapter 6: Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation for more information on health center service sites
and hours of operation.
18 See Chapter 17: Budget for more information on the Health Center Program project budget.

_Chapter 20: Board Composition_


  - The health center determines within its policies how to define “health care industry” for
purposes of board composition and how to determine the percentage of annual income
of each non-patient board member derived from the health care industry.


  - For health centers with a HRSA-approved waiver, the health center board determines
which strategies [21] to use for receiving input from the special population and ensuring
the special population’s participation in the direction and ongoing governance of the

health center.


21 For example, a health center could utilize an advisory council of special population representatives, could
conduct regular focus groups with the special population, or could have one or more patients from the special
population serving on the board.

of the PHS Act [1] for themselves and for their “covered individuals,” [2] Health Center Program
awardees and subrecipients (including those defined as subrecipients under the Health Center
FTCA Medical Malpractice Program regulations), [3] hereafter referred to as a “health center” in
this chapter, must submit for approval by HRSA an annual deeming application that

demonstrates the health center:


  - Has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to reduce the risk of malpractice
and the risk of lawsuits arising out of any health or health-related functions performed
by the health center;

  - Has reviewed and verified the professional credentials, references, claims history,
fitness, professional review organization findings, and license status of its physicians and
other licensed or certified health care practitioners;

  - Has no history of claims under section 224 of the PHS Act or, if such a history exists, fully
cooperates with the Attorney General in defending against any such claims, and takes
any necessary steps to assure against such claims in the future; and

  - Will fully cooperate with the Attorney General and other applicable agencies in
providing required information under section 224 of the PHS Act.

a. The health center is currently compliant with all of the credentialing and privileging

requirements of Chapter 5: Clinical Staffing and all requirements within Chapter 10:
Quality Improvement/Assurance prior to the deeming determination.

**Risk Management**


a. The health center has and currently implements an ongoing health care risk
management program to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes that could result in
medical malpractice or other health or health-related litigation and that requires the
following:

`◦` Risk management across the full range of health center health care activities;
`◦` Health care risk management training for health center staff;
`◦` Completion of quarterly risk management assessments by the health center; and
`◦` Annual reporting to the health center board, which includes: completed risk

and infection control) and any non-clinical trainings appropriate for health
center staff (including HIPAA medical record confidentiality requirements); and
`◦` Completing an annual risk management report for the board and key
management staff.


c. The health center provides reports to the board and key management staff on health
care risk management activities and progress in meeting goals at least annually, and
provides documentation to the board and key management staff showing that any
related follow-up actions have been implemented.


d. The health center has a health care risk management training plan for all staff members
and documentation showing that such trainings have been completed by the
appropriate staff, including all clinical staff, at least annually.


e. The health center designates an individual(s) (for example, a risk manager) who
oversees and coordinates the health center’s health care risk management activities and
completes risk management training annually.

**Claims Management**


a. The health center has a claims management process for addressing any potential or
actual health or health-related claims, including medical malpractice claims, that may be
eligible for FTCA coverage. In addition, this process ensures:

`◦` The preservation of all health center documentation related to any actual or
potential claim or complaint (for example, medical records and associated
laboratory and x-ray results, billing records, employment records of all involved
clinical providers, clinic operating procedures); and
`◦` Any service-of-process/summons that the health center or its provider(s)
receives relating to any alleged claim or complaint is promptly sent to the HHS
Office of the General Counsel, General Law Division, per the process prescribed
by HHS and as further described in the FTCA Health Center Policy Manual.


b. The health center has a designated individual(s) who is responsible for the management
and processing of claims-related activities and serves as the claims point of contact.

c. The health center informs patients using plain language that it is a deemed Federal PHS
employee [5] via its website, promotional materials, and/or within an area(s) of the health
center that is visible to patients.


d. If a history of claims under the FTCA exists, the health center can document that it:


5 For example: “This health center receives HHS funding and has Federal Public Health Service (PHS) deemed status
with respect to certain health or health-related claims, including medical malpractice claims, for itself and its
[covered individuals.” For more information, see Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).](https://bphc.hrsa.gov/initiatives/ftca)

_Chapter 21: Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) Deeming Requirements_


`◦` Cooperated with the Attorney General, as further described in the FTCA Health
Center Policy Manual; and
`◦` Implemented steps to mitigate the risk of such claims in the future.


_**Related Considerations**_

The following points describe areas where health centers have discretion with respect to
decision-making or that may be useful for health centers to consider when implementing these
requirements:


  - The health center determines how to obtain its health care risk management training
(for example, through one of HRSA’s national cooperative agreements or technical
assistance contracts) and which trainings to require for covered individuals and the
individual(s) designated with risk management responsibilities (for example, risk
manager).

  - The health center determines what other types of liability coverage to obtain, such as
private “gap” or “tail” insurance, directors and officer insurance, and general liability
insurance, for activities that may not be eligible for FTCA coverage.

  - The health center determines how to conduct and document the completion of
quarterly risk management assessments.

  - With the exception of health centers that use volunteer health professionals, as to
which requirements are prescribed by law, [6] the health center determines how to inform
patients that it is a deemed Federal Public Health Service employee.
