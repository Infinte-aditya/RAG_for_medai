## **CHAPTER ONE**

### **What is health insurance?**

Good health is the foundation of happiness. But factors like smoking,
alcohol consumption, climate change, increased population, etc. make
us more susceptible to health problems.


While no one likes thinking about the possibility of being injured or
hospitalised, it is pertinent to be prepared for any scenario because
the financial impact of these treatments can be huge.


A health insurance plan combats this problem. It is a comprehensive
cover for hospitalisation expenses incurred by you for any illness,
accident, or injury. The expenses can include hospitalisation costs, the
cost of medicines, doctor consultation fees, etc.


Health insurance acts as a protective shield for savings and
healthcare, so you and your loved ones can live a happy, fulfilling life.


###### **03**


## **CHAPTER TWO**

### **Why do you need health** **insurance?**

With an active policy in place, you can get the best treatments and
the following benefits 

**MEET RISING MEDICAL EXPENSES**


With the advent of new emerging diseases,
come breakthrough medical technologies.
However, the cost of getting quality treatment
is rising exponentially. The growth of science
brings advanced treatments, which are really
expensive due to new drug development


methods and increased efficacy. A shortage of specialist doctors and
surgeons in a particular field also causes medical inflation.


The importance of health insurance is vital in dealing with this
situation. It helps you and your family effectively manage the high
expenses and lead a healthier life.


For example, WHO identified SARS-CoV-2, Crimean Congo
hemorrhagic fever, and Ebola virus disease as the top
emerging diseases/conditions. If you get diagnosed with any
of them, you would need advanced treatment - from multiple
consultations and medical tests to medicines and room rent.

With a health insurance policy, you don’t have to worry about
the big hospital bills while you are already going through
physical and mental anguish.


###### **04**


**SAFEGUARD YOUR FAMILY**


Your family means the most to you, and
ensuring their good health and safety is of
primary importance. Should anything happen
to them, you will be ready to provide the best,
state-of-the-art medical facilities and help
them recover quickly.


Consider your ageing parents, they might need to get hospitalised due
to some age-related issues like joint replacement, heart conditions,
etc. and the doctor would recommend multiple X-rays, MRI scans, and
other tests to determine the illness. These can be covered under a

health insurance policy.


**GET MORE ENHANCED COVERAGE THAN A HEALTHCARE FUND**


A Healthcare Fund is basically your savings for
healthcare expenses. This can be done by
stowing away a certain amount, putting your
money in some investment option like a fixed
deposit, etc.


While this could be useful, it should not be a replacement for health
insurance. The treatment and surgery fees in today’s time could cost a
fortune, therefore, a healthcare fund will not be enough to deal with
all the medical expenses.


**PROTECT YOUR SAVINGS**


You have been saving money over the years
to fulfil some future dreams and goals, like buying a house, giving your children a topclass education, your peaceful retirement, etc.


###### **05**


An unforeseen illness can drain your savings, all at once. But with a
health insurance policy, you can manage your medical expenditure
without dipping into your savings. In fact, some insurance companies
offer cashless treatment, so you don't have to stress about
reimbursements either.


**GET THE MOST WHILE YOU ARE YOUNG**


Generally, you are required to undergo
medical tests before issuing a health insurance
policy. Please note that some insurers make
medical tests mandatory after age 45. This
varies across insurers.


The results of such tests will decide whether you will get health
insurance or not. The older you grow, the more you get exposed to
medical issues, like diabetes, and cardiac and respiratory diseases.
Hence, there are higher chances that you won't get a health insurance
policy. And even if you get one, you would have to pay a lot more for
a cover that would cost a lot less at your younger age. Therefore, go
for suitable health insurance coverage while you are still in the prime
of your life.


**AVAIL TAX BENEFITS**


Under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act,
1961, you can get deductions for the health
insurance premium paid for yourself, your
spouse, your dependent children, and your
parents. This further increases your savings.


However, reducing tax liabilities should not be your primary reason to
invest in health insurance.


###### **06**


## **CHAPTER THREE**

### **What costs are covered** **under health insurance?**

Health insurance generally covers 

**1️⃣ PRE-HOSPITALISATION COSTS**


You may incur costs related to tests or consultations before undergoing
treatment or getting admitted to the hospital. These are called prehospitalisation costs and are covered by Health Insurance. Most health
insurance plans cover pre-hospitalisation costs for 30 to 90 days.


Pre-hospitalisation costs include 
Blood tests

X-rays
OPD consultations fees

Diagnostic tests like ECG,

EEG

Urine test, etc.


For example, Lekha has health insurance with a sum insured
of Rs 10 lakhs. She gets mild chest pain, for which she
consults a doctor. He advises her to undergo an ECG to check
the condition of her heart. After examining the results, the
doctor tells her she has some complications and will require
hospitalisation for 2-3 days. The ECG, any other tests, room
rent, medicines, consultation fees, etc. shall be covered by her
health insurance policy.

###### **07**


**2️⃣ IN-PATIENT TREATMENT COSTS**


Being admitted to a hospital comes with certain hospitalisation
expenses. These may exceed your budget and drain your funds.
However, Health Insurance covers hospitalisation costs. In order to be
eligible for a claim, you must be hospitalised for at least 24 hours.


Here are some of the hospitalisation
expenses covered by health insurance 
Medical treatment expenses

Room rent

ICU charges
Surgery cost
Doctor consultation fees

Oxygen supply
Blood supply
Medicine costs, and so on.


However, there is an exception to the rule. It will be discussed in the
next point.


**3️⃣ DAYCARE TREATMENT EXPENSES**


Some surgeries or treatments don't require you to stay overnight in the
hospital (more than 24 hours). A health insurance policy covers these

too.


These treatments include 

Gallbladder removal

Hernia

Chemotherapy

Cataract

Dialysis, etc.


###### **08**


**4️⃣ POST-HOSPITALISATION COSTS**


Health insurance also covers the expenses that you incur after you are
discharged from the hospital. Typically, these plans cover posthospitalisation costs for 60 and 180 days. The following expenses are
covered under this category 

Regular check-up costs or
follow-up visits to your doctor
Diagnostic tests such as
colonoscopy, ECG, etc.
Rehabilitation costs

Physiotherapy sessions costs,
and so on.


For example, Madhav has health insurance with a sum insured
of Rs 5 lakhs. He underwent knee surgery and the surgery
cost approximately Rs 2 lakhs. The doctor scheduled
fortnightly medical appointments to keep an eye on the
surgical wound. His health insurance shall cover the surgery
costs and the follow-up consultation charges.


**5️⃣ ORGAN DONOR HOSPITALISATION**


Many health insurance plans also
cover the hospitalisation and surgical
costs incurred by the organ donor
during an organ transplant surgery. If
this type of coverage is not provided
under the plan, the expenses
incurred by the organ donor during
the period of hospital stay including
the room charges, surgery costs,
medicine costs, etc. will need to be
paid from the organ receiver's end.


###### **09**


**6️⃣ DOMICILIARY HOSPITALISATION**


If you are not in a condition to be moved to the hospital due to an
illness or injury, or if there are no hospital beds available, you can
receive treatment in the comfort of your home.


This is called Domiciliary Hospitalisation. Most health insurance plans
cover all costs associated with such home care. A registered physician
shall supervise the domiciliary treatment, and a paramedic or nurse
shall be on hand all the time to monitor you.


For example, Vimal has a health insurance policy with a sum
insured of Rs 5 lakhs. One morning, he was cleaning his house
when he slipped and fell down the stairs. He broke his right
leg and passed out. His brother called a doctor and explained
the situation. The doctor advised him not to take Vimal to the

hospital as any further movement could worsen the fracture.
So, he arranged for the entire treatment to be administered at
home. In this case, the complete domiciliary hospitalisation
costs including the medications shall be covered by Vimal's
health insurance.


###### **10**


## **CHAPTER FOUR**

### **Exclusions under health** **insurance**

Exclusions are the costs that health insurance doesn’t cover. There

are two types of exclusions - Permanent Exclusions and Temporary
Exclusions.


Let’s have a look at both.


**1. PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS**


Permanent exclusions are situations or conditions that are out of the

scope of coverage of the policy. And hence, they will never be covered
under health insurance. So, if you apply for a claim for such a condition
or a treatment, the insurer will not pay the claim.


For instance, Elena buys a health insurance
policy for a sum insured of Rs. 5 Lakhs.
There is a list of permanent exclusions in
the policy document, where one of the
exclusions mentioned is 'maternity costs'.
This means that any maternity-related
expenses incurred by Elena will not be
covered by her health insurance plan.


Types Of Permanent Exclusions
There are 2 types of permanent exclusions in health insurance 

1. Standard permanent exclusions
2. Additional permanent exclusions

Let's learn about both these types in detail.


###### **11**


Standard Permanent Exclusions

Every insurance company has a list of standard exclusions that they will
never cover. Here are a few examples of standard permanent
exclusions 

Diagnosis & Observation
If you’re admitted to the hospital just for
diagnosis and evaluation, then the expenses will
not be covered by health insurance.


For instance, Savio has some pains in his chest
and visits the hospital. The doctor does a basic
routine check and tells him to get admitted. While he’s in the hospital,
the doctor gives him some medicines and conducts some tests.


Other than this, no treatment is carried out - and he is discharged the
next day. The insurance company will not cover the expenses incurred
by Savio in this scenario.


Maternity Costs
Expenses related to pregnancy, childbirth, pre
and post-natal costs, etc. are generally not
covered under a health insurance policy. You,
however, can opt for the Maternity Benefit with
your base policy if you want your health
insurance to cover expenses related to maternity.


Obesity/ Weight Control
If you undergo any treatment primarily for
obesity, or to control your weight, the insurance
company won’t cover the expenses.


###### **12**


Drugs & Narcotics
The treatment for any illness or injury arising out
of excessive drug use, alcoholism, etc. is
permanently excluded by insurance companies.


Outpatient Expenses
Any expenses incurred when the medical
procedure is carried out in the outpatient
department are excluded permanently.


Suppose Ananya falls down the stairs, damages
her right leg, and her toes begin to bleed.
Her sister drives her to the hospital. The doctor tells Ananya’s sister to
take her to the Outpatient Department. After some time, a nurse
cleans and treats the wound. The doctor then prescribes some
painkillers and tells Ananya to rest at home for a few days.

Because Ananya’s wound was treated at the Outpatient Department,
health insurance will not pay for the expenses.


Note: A few insurance companies have now started providing
covers for OPD expenses in their policies as an optional or
add-on cover - where you will have to make an additional
payment to avail of it.


Change Of Gender Treatment
Health insurance will not cover any treatment
expenses that are carried out to change the
characteristics of the body to those of the
opposite sex.


###### **13**


Cosmetic/Plastic Surgery
The costs of medical procedures that are
undergone to change/enhance your looks or
appearance, etc. are not covered under health
insurance. For instance, breast or lip
augmentation, hair transplantation surgery,
rhinoplasty, etc. are not covered.


Unproven Treatments
The cost of treatments or surgeries for any illness
or injury that is not yet proven is not covered
under health insurance.


A profession in Risky or Adventure Sports
If you're professionally engaged in risky and
adventurous sports, such as parachuting, rock
climbing, mountaineering, motor racing, etc. and
get injured - the treatment costs won’t be
covered by health insurance.


Other costs

Administrative fees, registration fees, etc. are
some other expenses that are permanently
excluded from health insurance.


Note: The above list is not exhaustive. You need to check the

terms and conditions of the policy or speak to your financial
advisor to know the exact exclusions applicable to your
policy.

###### **14**


Additional Permanent Exclusions

Besides the standard permanent exclusions we've mentioned above,
insurance companies may apply additional exclusions for specific
situations or medical conditions.

Basically, if you're suffering from certain diseases or serious medical
conditions that the insurers find risky to cover, they may permanently
exclude them and then issue the policy to you.

However, it's important to note that insurers are restricted to a set of
illnesses listed under regulation for which they can apply a permanent
exclusion. Insurers cannot apply a permanent exclusion to diseases
outside this list.


For instance, Ajay, 25, has Hepatitis B and wants to apply for a
health insurance policy. The insurer, however, is finding it risky to
offer him coverage because of his medical history. So, they tell him
that they would provide him health insurance coverage only on one
condition - they will permanently exclude 'Hepatitis B'.


If Ajay agrees and buys the health
plan - and later undergoes
hospitalisation for a treatment that
is related to Hepatitis B, the
insurer won’t pay for the expenses.


Note: There might be situations, beyond the ones we've
covered in this article, that a health insurance policy won't
cover. So, ensure you check the policy wording before you go
ahead and make the purchase.

###### **15**


**2. TEMPORARY EXCLUSIONS**


Not every hospitalisation is covered under health insurance from day
1. A health insurance cover provides you with a lifetime cover on
hospitalisation, and hence opens up gradually over time. Suppose you
buy health insurance today and get hospitalised in the next week for,
say, treating pneumonia. In this case, your health insurance won't pay
for the pneumonia treatment. Wondering why?


Because of something called the 'Waiting Period' (also known as a
temporary exclusion).


What Is A Waiting Period?
For the purpose of keeping claims under control, and hence keeping
the health insurance plan affordable, health insurance plans do not
cover certain medical conditions or treatments for a specific period
when you buy the policy. This period is known as the ‘waiting period’.
You will be able to claim for those medical conditions and treatments

only after the waiting period is over.


For instance, Priya purchases a health plan under which the insurer
has applied a 1-year waiting period for an Appendectomy (surgical
operation for removing the appendix). Now, if Priya gets
hospitalised for an Appendectomy or a treatment that is related to
it, she’ll have to bear the hospitalisation expenses out of her
pocket until the waiting period for the Appendectomy is
completed under her policy, i.e., until 1 year.


Now that we’ve understood what

waiting periods are, let’s take a look at
the types of waiting periods in health
insurance.


###### **16**


**3 TYPES OF WAITING PERIODS IN HEALTH**

**INSURANCE YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF**


1. Initial Waiting Period
Only accidents are covered from day 1 under health insurance.
Insurance companies apply a 30-day waiting period for all other
treatments that are carried out during this period. This means health
insurance does not cover any treatment for or related to any medical
condition during the initial 30 days after the policy is issued.



This waiting period is
applicable only when
you first buy the
policy - it is not
applicable at the time
of renewal or when

you port the policy.





Example - Aisha buys a health insurance policy for a sum insured of
Rs. 10 Lakhs on 1st May 2022. Two weeks later, i.e., on 14th May,
she starts experiencing pain in her chest and is admitted to the
hospital.


She is hospitalised for 3 days and the hospital bill amounts to Rs.
75,000. Because the 30 days waiting period under her policy isn’t
over, she can’t apply for a claim under her health insurance plan.


2. Pre-existing Diseases Waiting Period
A pre-existing disease refers to any condition, ailment, injury, or
disease diagnosed or treated by a doctor 48 months prior to the date
of issue of your health insurance policy.


###### **17**


Note, a pre-existing disease
included in the waiting period
is very different from the
declaration of existing
diseases in the proposal form.
Your answers to questions on
the proposal form should be
complete and accurate, as far
as possible.


Example 1 - Gaurav was diagnosed with cancer last year, which is
now cured. If he applies for a health insurance plan now, cancer will
be considered a pre-existing disease.


Example 2 - Gaurav’s friend Sana had cancer in childhood, 10-12
years back. She did not undergo any treatment related to cancer in
the last 48 months. If Sana applies for a health insurance policy now,
she will have to inform the insurer of such a history, as per IRDAI
guidelines, and the insurer cannot consider this cancer as a preexisting disease.


Depending on the policy conditions, for pre-existing disease, they will
apply a waiting period of 2 to 4 years for pre-existing conditions.

So, in the above examples, the insurance company can apply a preexisting disease waiting period for Cancer under Gaurav’s policy, but
not under Sana’s policy.


###### **18**


3. Specified Disease/ Procedure Waiting Period
In addition to the above two waiting periods, the insurer also applies a
2-year waiting period for specific medical conditions and treatments like hernia, haemorrhoids, chronic kidney disease, spinal disorders, etc.
Once the waiting period is complete, you can start making claims for
such treatments.


The list of such illnesses is mentioned in the product brochure or policy
wording. You must know about the broad diseases excluded, so there
are no surprises if the claim is rejected.


Example - A 2-year waiting period for hernia is applicable under
Harsh’s health insurance policy. So, if Harsh is admitted to the
hospital for hernia treatment within the first two years after the
policy is issued, the insurance company will not cover the treatment

costs.


Note: Please keep in mind that the specific disease/
procedure waiting period is different from pre-existing
diseases, and not related to the medical declarations you
make at the time of purchase. For any disease included by the
insurer under pre-existing disease, the waiting period of preexisting disease mentioned in the policy schedule will apply.


###### **19**


## **CHAPTER FIVE**
### **Types of health insurance**

There are different types of health insurance, and each of them
serves a different purpose –


**👉 INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE**


As the name suggests, individual health insurance is designed
exclusively for an individual. It covers all medical charges, such as
surgery costs, pre and post-medical expenses, etc.


You can also enrol your family
members in this cover. They will
have separate coverage under the
same plan with their own sum
insured limit. Since you are adding
additional members to the same

plan, the premium might be on the
higher side.


For example, Mohan bought Individual Health Insurance with a sum
insured of Rs 5 Lakhs. He included his spouse Vidya and his son Aryan
under the same policy. Hence, they are also eligible to receive a sum
insured of Rs 5 Lakhs respectively under the same plan.


**👉 FAMILY FLOATER HEALTH INSURANCE**


A Family Floater Health Insurance plan covers everyone in your
household under a single plan. This means that a single sum insured
covers the entire family against any medical bills.


###### **20**


Under a single-family floater plan, you can insure yourself, your
spouse, up to 4 dependent children (less than 25 years of age), and up
to 2 parents or parents-in-law. Please note that some insurers allow
the combination of 1 parent + 1 parent-in-law. Some insurers may
also let you add aunts, uncles, siblings, etc. to the plan. The number of
members you can add to a floater policy will vary across insurers.


Since one policy is purchased for the entire family, the premium is
comparatively low. But as the premium is usually determined based
on age, including senior people's susceptibility to diseases, it may
result in a higher amount.


**👉 CRITICAL ILLNESS INSURANCE**


In this day and age, critical illnesses are on the rise. These illnesses may
necessitate prolonged treatments, and you may be well aware of how
expensive they are. It is prudent to obtain this coverage if your family
has a history of these illnesses, as a majority of chronic illnesses are
hereditary.


A Critical Illness policy is specifically designed to cover a variety of
diseases/illnesses such as –


Major organ transplant

Cancer

Aorta graft surgery
Kidney failure
Stroke

Multiple sclerosis
Paralysis
First heart attack

Coronary artery bypass surgery
Primary pulmonary arterial hypertension


Note: These policies have a waiting period of 30 days,
i.e., they will cover you after 30 days of policy purchase.
You shall receive a lump sum payment of the sum
assured when you file a claim.


###### **21**


**👉 SENIOR CITIZEN HEALTH INSURANCE**


This plan is designed for senior citizens who are usually above the age
of 60. This policy is apt for old people who are at high risk of
contracting diseases, so the premium is relatively high.


The medical treatment that comes with old age can take a huge toll on
your savings. However, this policy protects you against medical
expenses, including pre and post-hospitalisation expenses due to a
medical illness, including damages sustained due to an accident.


Other benefits include 

Domiciliary Hospitalisation - Medical treatment provided in the
comfort of your home in case you are unable to move to a hospital.
Psychiatric benefits - Treatments to improve mental health.


If you’re finding it difficult to cover one or both of your parents under a
regular health insurance plan, you can consider buying this plan for
them. Senior citizen health insurance policies may not require any
medical tests. They, however, usually come with a lot of restrictions
and limitations, like - waiting periods for PEDs, copay, room rent limit,
Sub-limits On Specific Treatments/ Diseases, and so on.

###### **22**


**👉 MATERNITY HEALTH INSURANCE**


Are you planning to start a family? A Maternity Cover can take care of
expenses related to a new stage in your life, including medical
treatment, delivery, pre and postnatal care, infertility expenses, etc.


A baby cover is also provided under
this insurance policy, wherein the
expenses related to the newborn
baby are covered up to the first 90
days.


Please note that the Maternity Cover
comes with a waiting period of 9
months to 4 years.


**👉 GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE**


Group health insurance plans are usually offered by many large
organisations to their employees. They provide coverage in case of an
accident, illness, critical illness, psychiatric illness, maternity, etc.


And, the premiums are affordable
since a group is covered under one
policy. Please note that the
employees are covered only until
they stay with the company.


###### **23**


**👉 TOP-UP AND SUPER TOP-UP HEALTH**

**INSURANCE**


Top-Up and Super Top-Up plans are essentially extensions to your
base health insurance plan. They start to pay after a certain amount is
crossed. This amount is known as a ‘deductible’.


This is how both plans work 

Top-Up

The deductible is calculated on each

hospitalisation. So, the Top-Up starts
paying only if the expenditure on one
hospitalisation crosses the deductible
limit.


Super Top-Up

The deductible is calculated based on the

sum total of all hospitalisation expenses
incurred during the year.


For example, Archie and Hiram are covered under health insurance
policies with cover amounts of Rs 15 Lakhs each. They both get
diagnosed with liver disease a few months after buying the policy.
Archie buys a Top-Up of Rs 20 Lakhs with a deductible limit of Rs 10
Lakhs. And Hiram buys a Super Top-Up of Rs 20 Lakhs with a
deductible limit of Rs 10 Lakhs.


Let’s assume they both undergo hospitalisation at the same time and
they incur similar medical expenses. Let’s understand how a Top-Up
will pay in Archie’s case and how a Super Top-Up will pay in Hiram’s

case.


###### **24**


|Hospitalisation|Claim<br>Amount|Archie’s Top-Up|Hiram’s Super Top-Up|
|---|---|---|---|
|First|8 Lakhs|Base plan will pay 8 Lakhs.|Base plan will pay 8<br>Lakhs.|
|Second|8 Lakhs|Base plan will pay 7 Lakhs.<br>Archie will have to pay 1<br>Lakh out of his pocket.<br>(Top-Up will not pay<br>anything because the claim<br>does not exceed the<br>deductible limit, i.e., 10<br>Lakhs.)|Base plan will pay 7<br>Lakhs. Super Top-Up will<br>pay 1 Lakh.|
|Third|12 Lakhs|Archie will have to pay 10<br>Lakhs out of his<br>pocket. Top-Up will pay 2<br>Lakhs.|Super Top-Up will pay<br>12 Lakhs.|


###### **25**


## **Summing Up!**

Owning a health insurance plan is a safety net that will protect you
and your family from medical treatments that are not easy on the
pocket. And each plan comes with its own features, benefits,
drawbacks, and T&Cs. Thus, it is important to understand each aspect
of health insurance - so you can make a wise choice.


This eBook has been written to serve as an easy-to-read and jargonfree guide that you can refer to whenever you need any information
