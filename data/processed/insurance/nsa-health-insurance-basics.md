# **Health Insurance Basics**

#### This document explains key health insurance concepts that may be helpful to consumers in understanding their health coverage as well as to consumer advocates who help individuals resolve medical billing problems. This resource is not intended to describe everything that is important to know about insurance. For more complete information, see the Coverage to Care resources developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

## **What is Health Insurance and Why is it Important?**

Health insurance is a legal entitlement to payment or reimbursement for your health care costs, generally
under a contract with a health insurance company. Health insurance provides important financial
protection in case you have an accident or sickness. For example, health insurance may help to pay for
doctors’ services, medications, hospital care, and special equipment when someone is sick or injured, often
in exchange for a monthly premium. It may help cover a stay at a rehabilitation hospital or even a portion
of home health care. Heath insurance can also keep a consumer’s costs down when they are not sick. For
example, it can help pay for routine check-ups. Most health insurance also covers many preventive services
at no cost, such as immunizations and cancer screening and counseling.

## **What is a Health Insurance Plan (also called a health plan or policy)?**


A health insurance plan includes a package of covered health care items and services and sets how much
it will pay for those items and services. In other words, a health plan will describe the types of health care
items and services it will cover (help pay for), how much it will pay for those items and services (or groups
of items and services), and for how long. Plans are often designed to last for a year at a time (known as
a “plan year” or “policy year”). A health plan may be a benefit that an employer, union, or other group
sponsor provides to employees or members to pay for their health care services.

## **What are Some Types of Health Care Coverage?**


Health care coverage is often grouped into two general categories: private and public. The majority of people
in the U.S. have private insurance, which they receive through their employer (which may include nongovernment employers or government employers at the federal, state or local level), buy directly from an
insurance company, or buy through a Health Insurance Marketplace®.1 Some people have public health care
coverage through government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Veteran’s Health Administration.


Health care coverage can also be categorized by the scope of benefits it offers or how long the coverage
lasts. Health insurance often includes a wide range of covered services, including emergency and nonemergency services as well mental health benefits. Some people have very limited insurance plans, such as
[plans with benefits for only specific conditions or diseases (included in the list of “excepted beneftsi](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-B/part-148/subpart-D/section-148.220) ” under
the Affordable Care Act, such as vision-only plans or cancer plans).

### **Health Insurance Basics**

As noted above, many health plans offer coverage for a year. However, some plans offer coverage for less
than 12 months, including plans created to fill gaps in coverage. These plans are called short-term limited
duration plans, and they often offer fewer benefits as compared to other health plans and lack some of the
consumer protections available under other forms of coverage.




## **Does a Health Plan Typically Pay for Services from Any Doctor?**

Not always. Some types of plans encourage or require consumers to get care from a specific set of doctors,
hospitals, pharmacies, and other medical service providers who have entered into contracts with the
plan to provide items and services at a negotiated rate. The providers in this designated set or network of
providers are called “in-network” providers.


y **In-Network Provider:** A provider who has a contract with a plan to provide
health care items and services at a negotiated (or discounted) rate to
consumers enrolled in the plan. Consumers will generally pay less if they
see a provider in the network. These providers may also be called “preferred
providers” or “participating providers.”


y **Out-of-Network Provider:** A provider who doesn’t have a contract with
a plan to provide health care items and services. If a plan covers outof-network services, _**the consumer usually pays more to see an out-of-network provider than an**_
_**in-network provider**_ _._ If a plan does not cover out-of-network services, then the consumer may, in most
non-emergency instances, be responsible for paying the full amount charged by the out-of-network
provider. Out-of-network providers may also be called “non-preferred” or “non-participating” providers.

### **Health Insurance Basics**

Some examples of plan types that use provider networks
include the following:


y **Health Maintenance Organization (HMO):** A type of
health insurance plan that usually limits coverage to care
from doctors who work for or contract with the HMO. It

generally won’t cover out-of-network care except in an
emergency, or when a prior authorization to obtain care
outside the network has been approved, or as otherwise
required by law. An HMO may require a consumer to live
or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage.
HMOs often provide integrated care and focus on
prevention and wellness. An HMO may require enrollees
to obtain a referral from a primary care doctor to access
other specialists.


y **Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO):** A type of
health plan where services are generally covered only
if the consumer uses in-network doctors, specialists, or
hospitals (except in an emergency). In general, EPOs do
not require a referral from a primary care doctor to see
other specialists, and in general there is very limited, if
any, out-of-network coverage.





y **Point of Service (POS):** A type of plan where a consumer pays less if they use in-network doctors,
hospitals, and other health care providers. POS plans may require consumers to get a referral from their
primary care doctor in order to see a specialist.


y **Preferred Provider Organization (PPO):** A type of health plan where consumers pay less if they use
in-network providers. They can use out-of-network doctors, hospitals, and providers without a referral
for an additional cost.

## **Insurance Costs**

Consumers typically pay the following types of costs when they have insurance.


y [Premium:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#premium) The premium is an amount of money a consumer pays for a health
insurance plan. The consumer and/or their employer usually make this payment
bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The premium must be paid regardless of
how many services, if any, the consumer uses.


y [Cost Sharing:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#CostSharing) Cost sharing is the share of costs for covered services that consumers must pay out of pocket.
This term generally includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, or similar charges, but it doesn’t
include premiums, balance billing amounts for out-of-network providers, or the cost of non-covered
services. Cost sharing in Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program also includes premiums.


y [Deductible:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#Deductible) The amount a consumer must pay for covered health care services received before their
plan begins to pay. For example, if a consumer’s deductible is $1,000, their plan won’t pay anything
until the consumer has paid $1,000 for covered health care services. A plan with an overall deductible
may also have separate deductibles that apply to specific services or groups of services. For example, a
plan may have separate in-network and out-of-network deductibles.


y [Copayment: A fixed amount ($20, for example) that a consumer pays for a covered health care service](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#Copayment)
after they’ve paid their deductible.


y [Coinsurance:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#Coinsurance) The percentage of the costs of a covered health care service that a consumer pays (for
example, 15% of the cost of a prescription) after paying a deductible.


See Appendix A for examples of how cost sharing works.

# **Appendix A**

## **Examples of Health Insurance Cost Sharing**

#### This appendix provides some examples of how health insurance cost sharing works for consumers. These examples show different outcomes depending on whether a consumer has met their deductible and whether their health insurance includes out-of-network coverage. This information is intended to illustrate some of the basic steps that are typically used to calculate cost sharing in the absence of consumer surprise billing protections (or when such protections don’t apply).

**IN-NETWORK:**
**A consumer receives covered items or services from an in-network provider or facility.**



If the services are covered by the consumer’s health plan and
furnished by an in-network provider or facility, the amount a
consumer pays will vary based on whether the consumer has met
their in-network deductible as well as the level of their coinsurance.

Note the “allowed amount” is the maximum payment the plan will
pay for a covered health care item or service and is generally the
basis for cost-sharing calculations.





In the next two examples, assume the consumer’s health plan specifies that coinsurance is 20 percent of
the allowed amount after the consumer has met a $2,000 deductible for in-network coverage.

|1. The consumer has not paid anything<br>toward the in-network deductible.|Example Amounts:|
|---|---|
|In-network provider bills health plan:|$1,000|
|Health plan “allowed amount” for provider:|$750|
|Health plan pays:|$0 (since consumer has not met deductible)|
|Consumer owes:|$750 (100 percent of allowed amount since consumer<br>has not met deductible)|
|Provider bills consumer:|$750|
|Total the consumer pays:|$750|



5


### **Health Insurance Basics**

|2. The consumer has fully met the<br>in-network deductible.|Example Amounts:|
|---|---|
|In-network provider bills health plan:|$1,000|
|Health plan “allowed amount” for provider:|$750|
|Health plan pays:|$600 (80 percent of allowed amount after deductible<br>is met)|
|Consumer coinsurance owed:|$150 (20 percent of allowed amount after deductible<br>is met)|
|Provider bills consumer:|$150|
|Total the consumer pays:|$150|



**OUT-OF-NETWORK:**
**The consumer receives covered items or services from an out-of-network provider.**


If the covered items or services are received out-of-network, a consumer’s
billed amounts will vary based on whether the consumer’s health plan provides
any out-of-network coverage and whether the consumer has met their out-ofnetwork deductible.


In some circumstances, the No Surprises Act may limit what a consumer may be
billed in each of the following examples. See the [No Surprises Act: Overview of Key](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf)

[Consumer Protections.](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf)

|3. The consumer has no out-of-network<br>coverage for the services.|Example Amounts:|
|---|---|
|Out-of-network provider bills health plan:|$1,000 (claim subsequently rejected for lack of out-of-<br>network coverage)|
|Health plan “allowed amount” for provider:|Not applicable – no out-of-network coverage|
|Health plan pays:|$0 (since no out-of-network coverage)|
|Consumer coinsurance owed:|Not applicable – no out-of-network coverage|
|Provider bills consumer:|$1,000 (provider bills full amount since consumer has<br>no out-of-network coverage)|
|Total the consumer pays:|$1,000|

### **Health Insurance Basics**

In the next two examples, the plan covers out-of-network services with consumer coinsurance of 40 percent
after the consumer has met a $4,000 deductible for out-of-network services. If the consumer has not paid
anything toward the out-of-network deductible, the provider would bill the consumer for the full amount
of the charges if the charges are less than $4,000 (example 4). If the consumer has already paid their full
deductible, a provider might balance bill a consumer for the difference between what the provider receives
from the health plan and the provider’s initial billed amount (example 5).

|4. The consumer has not paid anything<br>toward the out-of-network deductible.|Example Amounts:|
|---|---|
|Provider bills health plan:|$1,000|
|Health plan “allowed amount” for provider:|$550|
|Health plan pays:|$0 (deductible not met)|
|Consumer owes:|$550 (100 percent of allowed amount since consumer<br>has not met deductible)|
|Provider bills consumer:|$550 + possible $450 balance billed|
|Total the consumer pays:|$1,000 ($550 + $450)|


|5. The consumer has fully met the out-of-<br>network deductible.|Example Amounts:|
|---|---|
|Provider bills health plan:|$1,000|
|Health plan “allowed amount” for provider:|$550|
|Health plan pays:|$330 (60 percent of allowed amount after deductible is<br>met)|
|Consumer coinsurance owed:|$220 (40 percent of allowed amount after deductible is<br>met)|
|Provider bills consumer:|$220 + possibly $450 balance billed|
|Total the consumer pays:|$670 ($220 + $450)|
