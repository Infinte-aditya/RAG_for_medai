        "text": "On July **8,** **1996,** the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion [concerning]\nthe legality of the use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict The ruling followed a plea **by**\nboth the United Nations General Assembly and the WHO. **Of** significance from [a ] [health]\nperspective is the Court's companion opinion, handed down on the same day, which [held ] [that]\nWHO lacked standing to request such an advisory opinion.' The companion opinion was\nunprecedented in that the Court had never before refused to consider the request of a [specialized]\nagency of the [United ] [Nations ] [for ] [an ] [advisory ] [opinion.]\n\nThe Court began **by** stating that its power to issue an advisory opinion is exercisable upon\nthree conditions: **(1)** the agency requesting the opinion must be duly authorized under the\nUnited Nations Charter [8 ] to request advisory opinions; (2) [the ] [opinion ] [requested must ] [address]\n\na legal question; and **(3)** the question must be one arising [within ] [the ] [scope ] [of ] [the ] [activities ] [of]\nthe requesting agency.! The Court concluded that WHO had met the first two conditions,\nbut not the third.\n\n\nThe entire Court readily acknowledged that WHO is duly authorized to deal with the effects\non health of the use of nuclear weapons.'\" However, the majority determined [that ] [WHO's]\nrequest related to the _general_ _kgality_ of using nuclear weapons, as opposed to the _bealtb_ _[effects]_\nof such use.\" Because the issue of the general legality of using nudear weapons was found to\nbe outside the scope of WHO's specialized activities, the Court held that WHO [lacked ] [standing]\nto request an advisory opinion.\"\n\nThree judges dissented with the majority. Judge Shahabuddeen stated that the majority\nhad misinterpreted the fundamental question submitted **by** WHO.\" In his [view, ] [WHO's]\nquestion was more reasonably interpreted as whether use of nuclear weapons would violate\nWHO's Constitution [4] -not whether use was illegal in general.\" Judges Weeramantry [and]\nKoroma also felt that the majority had misconstrued WHO's question [as ] [merely ] [concerning]\ngeneral legality. [6 ] In their collective opinion, WHO's request directly related to WHO's\n\nactivities in at least three specific areas: (i) State obligations in regard to health; (ii) State\nobligations in regard to the environment; and (iii) State obligations under WHO [Constitu-]\ntion.\n\n\n**All** of the dissenters expressed additional concern over the Court's abrupt departure from\nits longstanding practice of routinely granting requests for advisory opinions, unless compelling\ncircumstances to decline exist.\n\n\n_**5.**_ _**Id.**_\n**6.** Request for Advisory Opinion from the World Health Organization on the Legality of the Use of [Nuclear]\nWeapons in Armed Conflict, **1996** **I.CJ.** No. **96/22** **(July** **8).**\n\n_**7.**_ _**Id.**_ at **3** (Weeramantry, **J.,** and Koroma, **J.,** dissenting).\n**8.** **U.N.** Charter, art. **96,** 2.\n**9.** **1996** **I.C.J.** **96/22** at **I** (Majority Opinion).\n**10.** _Id._\n\n**11.** _**Id.**_ at _**`5.`**_",

[27 ] It rejected the \"improper motive\" argument, finding that the primary\nobjective of Decision 96/239 was to protect public health in light of the perceived link between\nBSE and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.

U.S. Legislation\n\n\nAlthough major legislative activity may be forthcoming in 1997, Congress passed some\nlegislation related to the global EID problem in 1996. The U.S. Government adopted in 1996\nnew rules on federal meat inspection largely in response to outbreaks of _E._ _coli_ 0157:H in the\nUnited States in the early 1990s. [82 ] The United States also issued new regulations dealing with\nthe domestic and international shipment of etiologic agents that have potential for biological\nwarfare or bioterrorism.\" Congress also included in the new immigration legislation vaccination\nrequirements for all immigrants for a specified list of diseases to reduce the threat of disease\nimportation.\"\n\n\nIV. AIDS\n\n\nA. INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAn estimated 30.6 million people have been infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n(HIV) since the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was first recognized as a\ndisease. [8 5 ] Responses of international, national, and local organizations over the years have\nranged from compassion to hysteria. Major developments in 1996 demonstrate, at least in\ntheory, that responses to AIDS should be made within a public health framework that respects\nthe human rights of those affected by HIV. First, the United Nations undertook a major reform\nwhen it established UNAIDS, a coordinated mechanism to fight HIV by, among other measures,\nemphasizing the human rights of persons affected by HIV. Second, it is becoming generally\naccepted that various human rights instruments should extend to persons affected by HIV and\nAIDS. Third, medical developments in protease inhibitors announced at the 1996 International\nAIDS Conference held in Vancouver have turned the public perceptions of AIDS from being\nonly an inevitably fatal disease to being a disease that may, with access to new medicines, be\ntreated as a chronic illness. Although this development in AIDS treatment is not a legal development, it may shape future legislation and litigation on AIDS until the emergence of new strains\nof HIV that may be resistant to protease inhibitors.\n\n\nB. **UNAIDS** **ESTABLISHED** TO COORDINATE THE **INTERNATIONAL** FIGHT AGAINST AIDS\n\n\nAIDS has always presented a complex matrix of scientific, political, social, and legal issues.\nIn recognition of these and other complex aspects of HIV, the U.N. undertook a major reform\nof its own efforts against the disease. In January of 1996, a new Joint U.N. Program on HIV/\nAIDS (UNAIDS) became operational. UNAIDS did more than replace the World Health\nOrganization's Global Program on AIDS, which was itself a replacement of the World Health\nOrganization's Special Program on AIDS. The new organization, UNAIDS, is a common effort\nof six institutional cosponsors: the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United\nNations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the",

First,\nUNAIDS is the first strategic partnership program of its kind in the U.N. system to coordinate\na variety of efforts against a common health threat. Second, UNAIDS is the first U.N. program\nto include nongovernmental organization representation on its governing body, the Program\nCoordinating Board. [6 ] The board is comprised of 22 U.N. Member States (including donor\nand recipient nations), representatives of the six institutional cosponsors (UNICEF, UNDP,\nUNFPA, UNESCO, WHO, and the World Bank), nongovernmental organizations, and persons\nliving with HIV.\" The importance of including persons with HIV recognizes that programs can\nonly be successful if they involve those directly affected **by** the problem. Third, the coordinated\nstructure of UNAIDS allows the agency to promote human rights as a guiding principle. [8] \" As\nthe influence of UNAIDS and its emphasis on human rights becomes an accepted part of\neffective national response programs, the protection of human rights will remain a paramount\nconsideration.\n\nThe creation of UNAIDS may be viewed as a response to calls to streamline the U.N. system\nin this post-Cold War era. UNAIDS promises to be more than a model of reform, however.\nUNAIDS is poised to create support for coordinated responses to prevent further transmission\nof HIV, to provide care and support to persons already infected, and to reduce the vulnerability\nof individuals and communities who may be affected **by** HIV.\n\n\nC. **HUMAN** RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS PROTECT **PERSONS** **wrrH**\n\n\nHIV **AND** AIDS **AS** \"OTHER **STATUS\"**\n\n\nUNAIDS has stated that: \"People are entitled to enjoy all human rights without discrimination, induding discrimination based on HIV infection status. These [rights] include the right\nto health, travel, and privacy, the right to freedom from sexual violence and coercion, and the\nright to the information and means to prevent infection.\" [8 ] In the first decade of the AIDS\npandemic, most lawyers, legislators, and public health advocates generally discounted international human rights instruments as a framework to consider the rights of persons affected **by**\nHIV. [9° ] A common misperception was that public health considerations outweigh the individual\nhuman rights of persons affected **by** HIV. Although there are still many exceptions, it was\ngradually recognized that the public health could be protected without violating individual\nhuman rights. In the year 1996, there is growing evidence that human rights instruments\nprovide a paradigm to promote both human rights and public health.\n\nAn example is seen in the August 1996 deliberations of the Sub-Commission on Prevention\nof Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, a Sub-Commission of the U.N. Commission\non Human Rights. In its resolution on discrimination in the context of HIV or AIDS, the\nSub-Commission recognized that discrimination based on \"AIDS or HIV infection, actual or",

First, the Sub-Commission confirmed \"that discrimination on the basis\nof HIV or AIDS status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human\nrights standards and that the term 'other status' in nondiscrimination provisions in international\nhuman rights texts should be interpreted to cover health status, including HIV/AIDS.\" Second,\nthe Sub-Commission confirmed \"that it is appropriate to consider HIV/AIDS as a disability\nfor purposes of protection against discrimination.\"\n\nThe Sub-Commission's first pronouncement that the term \"other status\" includes persons\naffected by HIV applies to documents such as the _Universal_ _Declaration_ _of_ _Human_ _Rights,\"_\nwhich provides that all persons are \"entitled to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in this\nDeclaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion,\npolitical or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, _or_ _other_ _status.\"_ _[2 ]_ Similar\n\n\"other status\" language is found in Article 2(2) of _the_ _International_ _Covenant_ _on_ _Economic, Social,_\n\n_and_ _Cultural_ _Rigbts\"_ and in Article 2(1) of the _International_ _Covenant_ _on_ _Civil_ _and_ _Political_\n_Rigbts.1_ _[4 ]_ Analogous language can also be found in documents such as the _American_ _Declaration_\n_of_ _the_ _Rigbts_ _and_ _Duties_ _of_ _Man_ _[9]_ _\"_ which provides that \"[a]Ul persons are equal before the law\nand have the rights and duties established in this Declaration, without distinction as to race,\nsex, language, creed _or_ _any_ _other_ _factor.\"'_ _[6 ]_ Although countries initially signed the _American_\n_Declaration_ as a nonbinding declaration of human rights aspirations and political principles, the\n_Declaration_ has since evolved into a binding source of international obligation related to a\ncountry's membership in the Organization of American States. [97]\n\nThe Sub-Commission's observation made this year that the term \"other status\" should\ninclude persons affected by HIV builds on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights' 1995\nResolution on HIV/AIDS which confirmed that discrimination based on \"AIDS or HIV status,\nactual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards, and that\nthe term 'or other status' in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts",

As persons fail to comply with this regime, it is possible that new\nstrains of HIV may develop resistance to protease inhibitors, just as some strains now are\nresistant to the drug AZT. If this happens, the \"cure\" described in 1996 will be short-lived.\n\nUntil that time, however, nations where persons can afford the expense of protease inhibitors\nand related drugs may find a need to adjust their national laws. A person on disability leave,\nfor example, may find the strength to return to work following a successful treatment. The\ndisability laws, however, may impede a person from returning to work if that would endanger\nhealth insurance benefits. Persons with HIV can have more productive lives with this treatment,\nbut the expense will bankrupt many individuals and local governments. If that happens, a\nperson forced to stop treatment with protease inhibitors may develop strains that are resistant\nto further treatment. If the mutated virus spreads to others, treatment with protease inhibitors\nmay be futile. The potential danger of developing new, resistant strains of HIV should awaken\ngovernments to their own responsibilities to ensure that funds are available to pay for the\ntreatments. That understanding, however, requires more attention to the problem than most\nlegislators seem willing to give.\n\n\nVOL. **31,** NO. 2",
