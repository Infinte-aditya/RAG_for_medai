This further increases your savings.\n\n\nHowever, reducing tax liabilities should not be your primary reason to\ninvest in health insurance.\n\n\n###### **06**\n\n\n## **CHAPTER THREE**\n\n### **What costs are covered** **under health insurance?**\n\nHealth insurance generally covers \n\n**1️⃣ PRE-HOSPITALISATION COSTS**\n\n\nYou may incur costs related to tests or consultations before undergoing\ntreatment or getting admitted to the hospital. These are called prehospitalisation costs and are covered by Health Insurance. Most health\ninsurance plans cover pre-hospitalisation costs for 30 to 90 days.\n\n\nPre-hospitalisation costs include \nBlood tests\n\nX-rays\nOPD consultations fees\n\nDiagnostic tests like ECG,\n\nEEG\n\nUrine test, etc.\n\n\nFor example, Lekha has health insurance with a sum insured\nof Rs 10 lakhs. She gets mild chest pain, for which she\nconsults a doctor. He advises her to undergo an ECG to check\nthe condition of her heart. After examining the results, the\ndoctor tells her she has some complications and will require\nhospitalisation for 2-3 days. The ECG, any other tests, room\nrent, medicines, consultation fees, etc. shall be covered by her\nhealth insurance policy.\n\n###### **07**\n\n\n**2️⃣ IN-PATIENT TREATMENT COSTS**\n\n\nBeing admitted to a hospital comes with certain hospitalisation\nexpenses. These may exceed your budget and drain your funds.\nHowever, Health Insurance covers hospitalisation costs. In order to be\neligible for a claim, you must be hospitalised for at least 24 hours.\n\n\nHere are some of the hospitalisation\nexpenses covered by health insurance \nMedical treatment expenses\n\nRoom rent\n\nICU charges\nSurgery cost\nDoctor consultation fees\n\nOxygen supply\nBlood supply\nMedicine costs, and so on.\n\n\nHowever, there is an exception to the rule. It will be discussed in the\nnext point.\n\n\n**3️⃣ DAYCARE TREATMENT EXPENSES**\n\n\nSome surgeries or treatments don't require you to stay overnight in the\nhospital (more than 24 hours). A health insurance policy covers these\n\ntoo.\n\n\nThese treatments include \n\nGallbladder removal\n\nHernia\n\nChemotherapy\n\nCataract\n\nDialysis, etc.\n\n\n###### **08**\n\n\n**4️⃣ POST-HOSPITALISATION COSTS**\n\n\nHealth insurance also covers the expenses that you incur after you are\ndischarged from the hospital. Typically, these plans cover posthospitalisation costs for 60 and 180 days. The following expenses are\ncovered under this category \n\nRegular check-up costs or\nfollow-up visits to your doctor\nDiagnostic tests such as\ncolonoscopy, ECG, etc.\nRehabilitation costs\n\nPhysiotherapy sessions costs,\nand so on.\n\n\nFor example, Madhav has health insurance with a sum insured\nof Rs 5 lakhs. He underwent knee surgery and the surgery\ncost approximately Rs 2 lakhs. The doctor scheduled\nfortnightly medical appointments to keep an eye on the\nsurgical wound. His health insurance shall cover the surgery\ncosts and the follow-up consultation charges.\n\n\n**5️⃣ ORGAN DONOR HOSPITALISATION**\n\n\nMany health insurance plans also\ncover the hospitalisation and surgical\ncosts incurred by the organ donor\nduring an organ transplant surgery. If\nthis type of coverage is not provided\nunder the plan, the expenses\nincurred by the organ donor during\nthe period of hospital stay including\nthe room charges, surgery costs,\nmedicine costs, etc. will need to be\npaid from the organ receiver's end.\n\n\n###### **09**\n\n\n**6️⃣ DOMICILIARY HOSPITALISATION**\n\n\nIf you are not in a condition to be moved to the hospital due to an\nillness or injury, or if there are no hospital beds available, you can\nreceive treatment in the comfort of your home.\n\n\nThis is called Domiciliary Hospitalisation. Most health insurance plans\ncover all costs associated with such home care. A registered physician\nshall supervise the domiciliary treatment, and a paramedic or nurse\nshall be on hand all the time to monitor you.\n\n\nFor example, Vimal has a health insurance policy with a sum\ninsured of Rs 5 lakhs. One morning, he was cleaning his house\nwhen he slipped and fell down the stairs. He broke his right\nleg and passed out. His brother called a doctor and explained\nthe situation. The doctor advised him not to take Vimal to the\n\nhospital as any further movement could worsen the fracture.\nSo, he arranged for the entire treatment to be administered at\nhome. In this case, the complete domiciliary hospitalisation\ncosts including the medications shall be covered by Vimal's\nhealth insurance.\n\n\n###### **10**\n\n\n## **CHAPTER FOUR**\n\n### **Exclusions under health** **insurance**\n\nExclusions are the costs that health insurance doesn’t cover. There\n\nare two types of exclusions - Permanent Exclusions and Temporary\nExclusions.\n\n\nLet’s have a look at both.\n\n\n**1. PERMANENT EXCLUSIONS**\n\n\nPermanent exclusions are situations or conditions that are out of the\n\nscope of coverage of the policy. And hence, they will never be covered\nunder health insurance. So, if you apply for a claim for such a condition\nor a treatment, the insurer will not pay the claim.\n\n\nFor instance, Elena buys a health insurance\npolicy for a sum insured of Rs. 5 Lakhs.\nThere is a list of permanent exclusions in\nthe policy document, where one of the\nexclusions mentioned is 'maternity costs'.\nThis means that any maternity-related\nexpenses incurred by Elena will not be\ncovered by her health insurance plan.\n\n\nTypes Of Permanent Exclusions\nThere are 2 types of permanent exclusions in health insurance",

        "text": "Let's learn about both these types in detail.\n\n\n###### **11**\n\n\nStandard Permanent Exclusions\n\nEvery insurance company has a list of standard exclusions that they will\nnever cover. Here are a few examples of standard permanent\nexclusions \n\nDiagnosis & Observation\nIf you’re admitted to the hospital just for\ndiagnosis and evaluation, then the expenses will\nnot be covered by health insurance.\n\n\nFor instance, Savio has some pains in his chest\nand visits the hospital. The doctor does a basic\nroutine check and tells him to get admitted. While he’s in the hospital,\nthe doctor gives him some medicines and conducts some tests.\n\n\nOther than this, no treatment is carried out - and he is discharged the\nnext day. The insurance company will not cover the expenses incurred\nby Savio in this scenario.\n\n\nMaternity Costs\nExpenses related to pregnancy, childbirth, pre\nand post-natal costs, etc. are generally not\ncovered under a health insurance policy. You,\nhowever, can opt for the Maternity Benefit with\nyour base policy if you want your health\ninsurance to cover expenses related to maternity.\n\n\nObesity/ Weight Control\nIf you undergo any treatment primarily for\nobesity, or to control your weight, the insurance\ncompany won’t cover the expenses.\n\n\n###### **12**\n\n\nDrugs & Narcotics\nThe treatment for any illness or injury arising out\nof excessive drug use, alcoholism, etc. is\npermanently excluded by insurance companies.\n\n\nOutpatient Expenses\nAny expenses incurred when the medical\nprocedure is carried out in the outpatient\ndepartment are excluded permanently.\n\n\nSuppose Ananya falls down the stairs, damages\nher right leg, and her toes begin to bleed.\nHer sister drives her to the hospital. The doctor tells Ananya’s sister to\ntake her to the Outpatient Department. After some time, a nurse\ncleans and treats the wound. The doctor then prescribes some\npainkillers and tells Ananya to rest at home for a few days.\n\nBecause Ananya’s wound was treated at the Outpatient Department,\nhealth insurance will not pay for the expenses.\n\n\nNote: A few insurance companies have now started providing\ncovers for OPD expenses in their policies as an optional or\nadd-on cover - where you will have to make an additional\npayment to avail of it.\n\n\nChange Of Gender Treatment\nHealth insurance will not cover any treatment\nexpenses that are carried out to change the\ncharacteristics of the body to those of the\nopposite sex.\n\n\n###### **13**\n\n\nCosmetic/Plastic Surgery\nThe costs of medical procedures that are\nundergone to change/enhance your looks or\nappearance, etc. are not covered under health\ninsurance. For instance, breast or lip\naugmentation, hair transplantation surgery,\nrhinoplasty, etc. are not covered.\n\n\nUnproven Treatments\nThe cost of treatments or surgeries for any illness\nor injury that is not yet proven is not covered\nunder health insurance.\n\n\nA profession in Risky or Adventure Sports\nIf you're professionally engaged in risky and\nadventurous sports, such as parachuting, rock\nclimbing, mountaineering, motor racing, etc. and\nget injured - the treatment costs won’t be\ncovered by health insurance.\n\n\nOther costs\n\nAdministrative fees, registration fees, etc. are\nsome other expenses that are permanently\nexcluded from health insurance.\n\n\nNote: The above list is not exhaustive. You need to check the\n\nterms and conditions of the policy or speak to your financial\nadvisor to know the exact exclusions applicable to your\npolicy.\n\n###### **14**\n\n\nAdditional Permanent Exclusions\n\nBesides the standard permanent exclusions we've mentioned above,\ninsurance companies may apply additional exclusions for specific\nsituations or medical conditions.\n\nBasically, if you're suffering from certain diseases or serious medical\nconditions that the insurers find risky to cover, they may permanently\nexclude them and then issue the policy to you.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that insurers are restricted to a set of\nillnesses listed under regulation for which they can apply a permanent\nexclusion. Insurers cannot apply a permanent exclusion to diseases\noutside this list.\n\n\nFor instance, Ajay, 25, has Hepatitis B and wants to apply for a\nhealth insurance policy. The insurer, however, is finding it risky to\noffer him coverage because of his medical history. So, they tell him\nthat they would provide him health insurance coverage only on one\ncondition - they will permanently exclude 'Hepatitis B'.\n\n\nIf Ajay agrees and buys the health\nplan - and later undergoes\nhospitalisation for a treatment that\nis related to Hepatitis B, the\ninsurer won’t pay for the expenses.\n\n\nNote: There might be situations, beyond the ones we've\ncovered in this article, that a health insurance policy won't\ncover. So, ensure you check the policy wording before you go\nahead and make the purchase.\n\n###### **15**\n\n\n**2.

In this case, your health insurance won't pay\nfor the pneumonia treatment. Wondering why?\n\n\nBecause of something called the 'Waiting Period' (also known as a\ntemporary exclusion).\n\n\nWhat Is A Waiting Period?\nFor the purpose of keeping claims under control, and hence keeping\nthe health insurance plan affordable, health insurance plans do not\ncover certain medical conditions or treatments for a specific period\nwhen you buy the policy. This period is known as the ‘waiting period’.\nYou will be able to claim for those medical conditions and treatments\n\nonly after the waiting period is over.\n\n\nFor instance, Priya purchases a health plan under which the insurer\nhas applied a 1-year waiting period for an Appendectomy (surgical\noperation for removing the appendix). Now, if Priya gets\nhospitalised for an Appendectomy or a treatment that is related to\nit, she’ll have to bear the hospitalisation expenses out of her\npocket until the waiting period for the Appendectomy is\ncompleted under her policy, i.e., until 1 year.\n\n\nNow that we’ve understood what\n\nwaiting periods are, let’s take a look at\nthe types of waiting periods in health\ninsurance.\n\n\n###### **16**\n\n\n**3 TYPES OF WAITING PERIODS IN HEALTH**\n\n**INSURANCE YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF**",

So, if Harsh is admitted to the\nhospital for hernia treatment within the first two years after the\npolicy is issued, the insurance company will not cover the treatment\n\ncosts.\n\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that the specific disease/\nprocedure waiting period is different from pre-existing\ndiseases, and not related to the medical declarations you\nmake at the time of purchase. For any disease included by the\ninsurer under pre-existing disease, the waiting period of preexisting disease mentioned in the policy schedule will apply.\n\n\n###### **19**\n\n\n## **CHAPTER FIVE**\n### **Types of health insurance**\n\nThere are different types of health insurance, and each of them\nserves a different purpose –\n\n\n**👉 INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE**\n\n\nAs the name suggests, individual health insurance is designed\nexclusively for an individual. It covers all medical charges, such as\nsurgery costs, pre and post-medical expenses, etc.\n\n\nYou can also enrol your family\nmembers in this cover. They will\nhave separate coverage under the\nsame plan with their own sum\ninsured limit. Since you are adding\nadditional members to the same\n\nplan, the premium might be on the\nhigher side.\n\n\nFor example, Mohan bought Individual Health Insurance with a sum\ninsured of Rs 5 Lakhs. He included his spouse Vidya and his son Aryan\nunder the same policy. Hence, they are also eligible to receive a sum\ninsured of Rs 5 Lakhs respectively under the same plan.\n\n\n**👉 FAMILY FLOATER HEALTH INSURANCE**\n\n\nA Family Floater Health Insurance plan covers everyone in your\nhousehold under a single plan. This means that a single sum insured\ncovers the entire family against any medical bills.\n\n\n###### **20**\n\n\nUnder a single-family floater plan, you can insure yourself, your\nspouse, up to 4 dependent children (less than 25 years of age), and up\nto 2 parents or parents-in-law. Please note that some insurers allow\nthe combination of 1 parent + 1 parent-in-law. Some insurers may\nalso let you add aunts, uncles, siblings, etc. to the plan. The number of\nmembers you can add to a floater policy will vary across insurers.\n\n\nSince one policy is purchased for the entire family, the premium is\ncomparatively low. But as the premium is usually determined based\non age, including senior people's susceptibility to diseases, it may\nresult in a higher amount.\n\n\n**👉 CRITICAL ILLNESS INSURANCE**\n\n\nIn this day and age, critical illnesses are on the rise. These illnesses may\nnecessitate prolonged treatments, and you may be well aware of how\nexpensive they are. It is prudent to obtain this coverage if your family\nhas a history of these illnesses, as a majority of chronic illnesses are\nhereditary.\n\n\nA Critical Illness policy is specifically designed to cover a variety of\ndiseases/illnesses such as –\n\n\nMajor organ transplant\n\nCancer\n\nAorta graft surgery\nKidney failure\nStroke\n\nMultiple sclerosis\nParalysis\nFirst heart attack\n\nCoronary artery bypass surgery\nPrimary pulmonary arterial hypertension\n\n\nNote: These policies have a waiting period of 30 days,\ni.e., they will cover you after 30 days of policy purchase.\nYou shall receive a lump sum payment of the sum\nassured when you file a claim.\n\n\n###### **21**\n\n\n**👉 SENIOR CITIZEN HEALTH INSURANCE**\n\n\nThis plan is designed for senior citizens who are usually above the age\nof 60. This policy is apt for old people who are at high risk of\ncontracting diseases, so the premium is relatively high.\n\n\nThe medical treatment that comes with old age can take a huge toll on\nyour savings. However, this policy protects you against medical\nexpenses, including pre and post-hospitalisation expenses due to a\nmedical illness, including damages sustained due to an accident.\n\n\nOther benefits include \n\nDomiciliary Hospitalisation - Medical treatment provided in the\ncomfort of your home in case you are unable to move to a hospital.\nPsychiatric benefits - Treatments to improve mental health.\n\n\nIf you’re finding it difficult to cover one or both of your parents under a\nregular health insurance plan, you can consider buying this plan for\nthem. Senior citizen health insurance policies may not require any\nmedical tests. They, however, usually come with a lot of restrictions\nand limitations, like - waiting periods for PEDs, copay, room rent limit,\nSub-limits On Specific Treatments/ Diseases, and so on.\n\n###### **22**\n\n\n**👉 MATERNITY HEALTH INSURANCE**\n\n\nAre you planning to start a family? A Maternity Cover can take care of\nexpenses related to a new stage in your life, including medical\ntreatment, delivery, pre and postnatal care, infertility expenses, etc.\n\n\nA baby cover is also provided under\nthis insurance policy, wherein the\nexpenses related to the newborn\nbaby are covered up to the first 90\ndays.\n\n\nPlease note that the Maternity Cover\ncomes with a waiting period of 9\nmonths to 4 years.\n\n\n**👉 GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE**\n\n\nGroup health insurance plans are usually offered by many large\norganisations to their employees. They provide coverage in case of an\naccident, illness, critical illness, psychiatric illness, maternity, etc.\n\n\nAnd, the premiums are affordable\nsince a group is covered under one\npolicy. Please note that the\nemployees are covered only until\nthey stay with the company.\n\n\n###### **23**\n\n\n**👉 TOP-UP AND SUPER TOP-UP HEALTH**\n\n**INSURANCE**\n\n\nTop-Up and Super Top-Up plans are essentially extensions to your\nbase health insurance plan. They start to pay after a certain amount is\ncrossed. This amount is known as a ‘deductible’.\n\n\nThis is how both plans work \n\nTop-Up\n\nThe deductible is calculated on each\n\nhospitalisation. So, the Top-Up starts\npaying only if the expenditure on one\nhospitalisation crosses the deductible\nlimit.\n\n\nSuper Top-Up\n\nThe deductible is calculated based on the\n\nsum total of all hospitalisation expenses\nincurred during the year.\n\n\nFor example, Archie and Hiram are covered under health insurance\npolicies with cover amounts of Rs 15 Lakhs each. They both get\ndiagnosed with liver disease a few months after buying the policy.\nArchie buys a Top-Up of Rs 20 Lakhs with a deductible limit of Rs 10\nLakhs. And Hiram buys a Super Top-Up of Rs 20 Lakhs with a\ndeductible limit of Rs 10 Lakhs.\n\n\nLet’s assume they both undergo hospitalisation at the same time and\nthey incur similar medical expenses. Let’s understand how a Top-Up\nwill pay in Archie’s case and how a Super Top-Up will pay in Hiram’s\n\ncase.\n\n\n###### **24**\n\n\n|Hospitalisation|Claim<br>Amount|Archie’s Top-Up|Hiram’s Super Top-Up|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|First|8 Lakhs|Base plan will pay 8 Lakhs.|Base plan will pay 8<br>Lakhs.|\n|Second|8 Lakhs|Base plan will pay 7 Lakhs.<br>Archie will have to pay 1<br>Lakh out of his pocket.<br>(Top-Up will not pay<br>anything because the claim<br>does not exceed the<br>deductible limit, i.e., 10<br>Lakhs.)|Base plan will pay 7<br>Lakhs. Super Top-Up will<br>pay 1 Lakh.|\n|Third|12 Lakhs|Archie will have to pay 10<br>Lakhs out of his<br>pocket. Top-Up will pay 2<br>Lakhs.|Super Top-Up will pay<br>12 Lakhs.|\n\n\n###### **25**\n\n\n## **Summing Up!**\n\nOwning a health insurance plan is a safety net that will protect you\nand your family from medical treatments that are not easy on the\npocket. And each plan comes with its own features, benefits,\ndrawbacks, and T&Cs. Thus, it is important to understand each aspect\nof health insurance - so you can make a wise choice.\n\n\nThis eBook has been written to serve as an easy-to-read and jargonfree guide that you can refer to whenever you need any information\nabout health insurance.\n\n\nWe hope it makes your health insurance journey a bit easier! :)\n\n\n###### **26**",

However, some plans offer coverage for less\nthan 12 months, including plans created to fill gaps in coverage. These plans are called short-term limited\nduration plans, and they often offer fewer benefits as compared to other health plans and lack some of the\nconsumer protections available under other forms of coverage.\n\n\n\n\n## **Does a Health Plan Typically Pay for Services from Any Doctor?**\n\nNot always. Some types of plans encourage or require consumers to get care from a specific set of doctors,\nhospitals, pharmacies, and other medical service providers who have entered into contracts with the\nplan to provide items and services at a negotiated rate. The providers in this designated set or network of\nproviders are called “in-network” providers.\n\n\ny **In-Network Provider:** A provider who has a contract with a plan to provide\nhealth care items and services at a negotiated (or discounted) rate to\nconsumers enrolled in the plan. Consumers will generally pay less if they\nsee a provider in the network. These providers may also be called “preferred\nproviders” or “participating providers.”\n\n\ny **Out-of-Network Provider:** A provider who doesn’t have a contract with\na plan to provide health care items and services. If a plan covers outof-network services, _**the consumer usually pays more to see an out-of-network provider than an**_\n_**in-network provider**_ _._ If a plan does not cover out-of-network services, then the consumer may, in most\nnon-emergency instances, be responsible for paying the full amount charged by the out-of-network\nprovider.

The consumer and/or their employer usually make this payment\nbi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The premium must be paid regardless of\nhow many services, if any, the consumer uses.\n\n\ny [Cost Sharing:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#CostSharing) Cost sharing is the share of costs for covered services that consumers must pay out of pocket.\nThis term generally includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, or similar charges, but it doesn’t\ninclude premiums, balance billing amounts for out-of-network providers, or the cost of non-covered\nservices. Cost sharing in Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program also includes premiums.\n\n\ny [Deductible:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#Deductible) The amount a consumer must pay for covered health care services received before their\nplan begins to pay. For example, if a consumer’s deductible is $1,000, their plan won’t pay anything\nuntil the consumer has paid $1,000 for covered health care services. A plan with an overall deductible\nmay also have separate deductibles that apply to specific services or groups of services. For example, a\nplan may have separate in-network and out-of-network deductibles.\n\n\ny [Copayment: A fixed amount ($20, for example) that a consumer pays for a covered health care service](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#Copayment)\nafter they’ve paid their deductible.\n\n\ny [Coinsurance:](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-toolkit-glossary.pdf#Coinsurance) The percentage of the costs of a covered health care service that a consumer pays (for\nexample, 15% of the cost of a prescription) after paying a deductible.\n\n\nSee Appendix A for examples of how cost sharing works.",

These examples show different outcomes depending on whether a consumer has met their deductible and whether their health insurance includes out-of-network coverage. This information is intended to illustrate some of the basic steps that are typically used to calculate cost sharing in the absence of consumer surprise billing protections (or when such protections don’t apply).\n\n**IN-NETWORK:**\n**A consumer receives covered items or services from an in-network provider or facility.**\n\n\n\nIf the services are covered by the consumer’s health plan and\nfurnished by an in-network provider or facility, the amount a\nconsumer pays will vary based on whether the consumer has met\ntheir in-network deductible as well as the level of their coinsurance.\n\nNote the “allowed amount” is the maximum payment the plan will\npay for a covered health care item or service and is generally the\nbasis for cost-sharing calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next two examples, assume the consumer’s health plan specifies that coinsurance is 20 percent of\nthe allowed amount after the consumer has met a $2,000 deductible for in-network coverage.\n\n|1. The consumer has not paid anything<br>toward the in-network deductible.|Example Amounts:|\n|---|---|\n|In-network provider bills health plan:|$1,000|\n|Health plan “allowed amount” for provider:|$750|\n|Health plan pays:|$0 (since consumer has not met deductible)|\n|Consumer owes:|$750 (100 percent of allowed amount since consumer<br>has not met deductible)|\n|Provider bills consumer:|$750|\n|Total the consumer pays:|$750|",
