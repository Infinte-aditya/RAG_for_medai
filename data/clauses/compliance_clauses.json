[16]\n\n\nHRSA is committed to providing a reasonable period of time for these organizations to take\ncorrective actions necessary to demonstrate compliance. Progressive Action is designed to\nprovide a time-phased approach for resolution of compliance issues with program\nrequirements. This Progressive Action process is not intended to address or be used for the\noversight and enforcement of all Federal requirements that may be applicable to the award or\ndesignation, particularly those with implications for patient safety (see Immediate Enforcement\nActions below).\n\nShould a health center fail to adequately address conditions through Progressive Action, HRSA\nmay utilize available remedies, including terminating all or part of the Federal\naward/designation status before the health center’s current project end date. [17] Such action\n\nmay be accompanied by a competition to identify another organization to carry out a service\ndelivery program consistent with Federal requirements. [18]\n\n\n_**Progressive Action Process**_\n\nIn circumstances where HRSA has determined that a health center has failed to demonstrate\n\ncompliance with one or more Health Center Program requirements, relevant conditions are\nplaced on the health center’s award/designation and communicated through Notices of Award\n(NoAs) or Notices of Look-Alike Designation (NLDs). In responding to such conditions, health\ncenters could demonstrate their compliance to HRSA either by submitting documentation as\ndescribed in the Demonstrating Compliance sections of the Manual, or by the health center\nproposing an alternative means of demonstrating compliance with the specified requirements,\nwhich would include submitting an explanation and documentation that explicitly\ndemonstrates compliance. All responses to conditions are subject to review and approval by\n\nHRSA.\n\nThe Progressive Action process provides a uniform structure and a time-phased approach for\nnotifying health centers of the failure to demonstrate compliance and for receiving health\ncenter responses to an identified condition(s) as supported within HRSA’s EHB. Through this\nprocess, health centers are able to efficiently and effectively respond to conditions, and HRSA is\nable to promptly review these responses and proceed to next steps, including removal of\nconditions, as warranted. In addition, the EHB supports the Progressive Action process by\nclearly noting condition response deadlines in the health center’s EHB task list and providing\nperiodic reminders to health centers during the condition response timeframe.",

After initial notification of the compliance issue, a health center will be notified via a\nNoA/NLD at each Progressive Action phase as to the acceptability of the response and whether\nfurther action is needed. If the health center fails to respond by the specified deadline or HRSA\ndetermines that the health center’s response does not demonstrate compliance, the health\ncenter will be notified and the next Progressive Action phase will be activated.\n\n\n  Phase One: An initial NoA/NLD is issued with a condition detailing the specific area(s)\nwhere compliance with a requirement has not been demonstrated. Phase One provides\nninety (90) days for the health center to submit appropriate documentation that\ndemonstrates compliance or, where applicable, that the health center has developed an\nadequate action plan (see Implementation Phase below) for how its organization will\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirement. [19 ]\n\n  - Phase Two: Phase Two provides an additional sixty (60) days for the health center to\nsubmit appropriate documentation that demonstrates compliance or that the health\ncenter has developed an adequate action plan for how its organization will demonstrate\ncompliance with the requirement (See Implementation Phase below).\n\n  - Phase Three: Phase Three provides an additional thirty (30) days for the health center to\nsubmit appropriate documentation that demonstrates compliance or that the health\ncenter has developed an adequate action plan for how its organization will demonstrate\ncompliance with the requirement (See Implementation Phase below).\n\n  - Implementation Phase (where applicable): Implementation Phase provides one hundred\ntwenty (120) days for the health center to implement the HRSA-approved action plan\nand submit appropriate documentation that demonstrates compliance with the\nprogram requirement. [20 ]\n\n\nHRSA recognizes that health centers may need to make programmatic and organizational\nchanges in response to a condition. Therefore, the Progressive Action process is designed to\nprovide health centers with a reasonable amount of time to take appropriate action in response\nto a condition and for prompt HRSA review and decision-making. For example, in Phase One, a\nhealth center is given 90 days to either demonstrate compliance with the identified program\nrequirement or develop and submit an action plan detailing the steps the health center will\nimplement in order to demonstrate compliance with the requirement. If this plan is approved, a\nNoA/NLD will be issued with an “Implementation Phase” condition notifying the health center\nthat HRSA has approved the action plan and that within 120 days it must submit documentation\nthat compliance with the requirement has been demonstrated in accordance with the HRSAapproved plan.",

In such cases, based on the circumstances, HRSA\nmay take one or more of the following immediate remedies:\n\n\n  - Temporarily withhold cash payments (from the Federal award) pending further action;\n\n  - Disallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;\n\n  - Wholly or partly suspend award activities or terminate the Federal award;\n\n  - Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings;\n\n  - Withhold further Federal awards for the project or program; or\n\n  - Take other remedies that may be legally available.
